00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,310
这次又是谁需要我
Who needs me this time?

159
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,420
想我了吗
Miss me?

160
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,480
英国需要你
England.

161
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,170
第二次阿富汗大战令很多人载誉而归  加官进爵
"The Second Afghan War brought honours and promotion to many.

162
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,620
但对我而言  这无疑是一场彻头彻尾的灾难
"But, for me, it meant nothing but misfortune and disaster."

163
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,620
好了  上尉
All right, Captain.

164
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,050
我重返英国  身体落下了终身的伤痛
"I returned to England with my health irretrievably ruined

165
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,670
前途一片黯淡
"and my future bleak.

166
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,890
鉴于此  我自然搬来了伦敦
"Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London.

167
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,980
这是众多游手好闲者
"That great cesspool into which all the loungers..."

168
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,610
-华生  -及闲散人士的游走之所
- Watson! - "..and idlers of the empire are drained."

169
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,720
华生
Watson!

170
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,100
我是史丹佛
Stamford.

171
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,410
还记得我吗
Remember?

172
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,370
我们以前一起在巴茨医院共事
We were at Barts together.

173
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,130
当然记得  史丹佛
Yes, of course. Stamford.

174
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,340
老天爷  你这是跑哪混去了
Good Lord! Where have you been?

175
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,050
搞得骨瘦如柴的
You're as thin as a rake!

176
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,600
我起码活着回来了  许多人还没这个福气
I made it home. Many weren't so lucky.

177
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,720
那现在呢
So what now?

178
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,540
我得找个住处落脚
I need a place to live.

179
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,330
条件好  价格优  这种地方可不好找
Somewhere decent at an affordable price. It's not easy.

180
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,880
今天还有个人和我这么说过
You know, you're the second person to say that to me today.

181
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,780
是谁
Who was the first?

182
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,730
老天爷
Good Lord.

183
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,640
据说是个实验
It's an experiment, apparently.

184
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,490
鞭笞尸体  以确立在死亡后多久
Beating corpses to establish how long after death

185
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,580
人体仍能形成瘀伤
bruising is still possible.

186
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,810
这有何医学意义吗
Is there a medical point to that?

187
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,520
我不确定
Not sure.

188
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,210
我也不确定  你所说的那位朋友呢
Neither am I. So, where's this friend of yours, then?

189
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,670
不好意思
Excuse me.

190
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,240
但愿我们没打扰到你
I do hope we're not interrupting.

191
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,830
你应该去过阿富汗吧
You've been in Afghanistan, I perceive.

192
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,030
华生医生  这位是夏洛克先生
Dr Watson, Mr Sherlock...

193
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,770
反应敏捷  你是个合适人选
Excellent reflexes, you'll do.

194
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,030
你说什么
I'm sorry...?

195
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,810
我看上了摄政公园附近的一套房子
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park.

196
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,290
我们一起应该能付得起房租
Between us we could afford them.

197
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,160
房子  谁说过房子的事情了
Rooms? Who said anything about rooms?

198
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,350
是我  我今早跟史丹佛提过
I did, I mentioned it to Stamford this morning,

199
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,530
我需要一位合租者
I was in need of a fellow lodger.

200
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,540
而他在午饭后
Now he appears after lunch

201
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,300
便带来了一位军人模样的男子
in the company of a man of military aspect

202
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,540
皮肤黝黑  最近受过伤
with a tan and a recent injury,

203
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,810
这两个特点都暗示了你参加过阿富汗战争
both suggestive of the campaign in Afghanistan

204
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,320
并被迫离开了战场
and an enforced departure from it.

205
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,260
这似乎是个必然的结论
The conclusion seemed inescapable.

206
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,810
我们明晚再敲定细节
We'll finalise the details tomorrow evening.

207
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,640
失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

208
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,820
旺兹沃思有一场绞刑
I have a hanging in Wandsworth

209
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,810
我可不想错过
and I'd hate them to start without me.

210
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,740
-绞刑  -这属于我的职业范畴
- A hanging? - I take a professional interest.

211
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,390
我还拉小提琴  抽烟斗
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe.

212
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,800
这应该不成问题吧
I presume that's not a problem.

213
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,630
是的
Er, no, well...

214
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,420
你显然习惯了从来不把话说完
And you're clearly acclimatized to never getting to the end of a sentence.

215
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,890
我们会相处得非常愉快
We'll get along splendidly.

216
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,150
那就约好明晚七点
Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock, then.

217
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,960
对了  我叫夏洛克·福尔摩斯
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes

218
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,150
地址是贝克街221B 
and the address is 221B, Baker Street.

219
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,380
是的  他一直都是这个样子
Yes...he's always been like that.

220
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,880
卖报  卖报
Papers! Papers!

221
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,700
卖报  卖报
Papers! Papers!

222
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,990
喂  《蓝宝石奇案》卖得怎么样
Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle doing?

223
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,990
非常受欢迎  华生医生
Very popular, Dr Watson.

224
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,480
下个月会有正经的谋杀案吗
Is there going to be a proper murder next month?

225
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,240
我会跟罪犯们谈一谈
I'll have a word with the criminal classes.

226
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,660
那就拜托你了
If you wouldn't mind.

227
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,660
那是他吗  他在车里吗
Is that him? Is he in there?

228
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
不  不不  车里不是他
No. No, no, not at all.

229
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,290
再见
Er, good day to you.

230
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,530
走吧
Let on, walk.

231
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,290
圣诞快乐  福尔摩斯先生
Merry Christmas, Mr Holmes!

232
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

233
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,480
我希望你打算回家之前能跟我打声招呼
I do wish you'd let me know when you're planning to come home!

234
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,430
连我自己都说不准  赫德森太太
I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson.

235
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,070
这就是乡绅分尸案的棘手之处
That's the trouble with dismembered country squires.

236
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,140
想提前安排日程真是难如登天
They're notoriously difficult to schedule.

237
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,980
-这里面是什么  -别管了
- What's in there? - Never mind.

238
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,060
谢谢
Thank you.

239
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,070
你抓到杀人凶手了吗  福尔摩斯先生
Did you catch the murderer, Mr Holmes?

240
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,730
凶手抓到了  但还在找被肢解的腿
Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs.

241
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,130
就算是打了个平手吧
I think we'll call it a draw.

242
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,370
我看到你又发表了一篇故事  华生医生
And I noticed you've published another of your stories, Dr Watson.

243
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,930
是的  你喜欢吗
Yes, did you enjoy it?

244
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,280
不喜欢
No.

245
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,470
-我一直都不喜欢  -为什么
- I never enjoy them. - Why not?

246
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,060
我从来连句台词都没有
Well, I never say anything, do I?

247
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,360
据你所写  我就只负责带人上楼
According to you, I just show people up the stairs

248
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,650
给你们做早餐而已
and serve you breakfasts.

249
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,680
在故事当中
Well, within the narrative,

250
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,460
这大致上就是你的职能
that is, broadly speaking, your function.

251
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,750
我的什么
My what?!

252
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,290
别觉得受了针对  赫德森太太
Don't feel singled out, Mrs Hudson,

253
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,580
-写狗的那篇我都没太露脸  -写狗的那篇
- I'm hardly in the dog one. - "The dog one?"

254
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,410
我是你们的房东  而不是情节设置
I'm your landlady, not a plot device.

255
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,900
你是指《巴斯克维尔的猎犬》吗
Do you mean The Hound Of The Baskervilles?

256
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,450
而且你把房子搞得那么沉闷昏暗
And you make the rooms so drab and dingy.

257
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,660
这你得怪插画家  他简直胡来
Oh, blame it on the illustrator, he's out of control!

258
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,520
我还得留着八字胡  好让大家能认出我来
I've had to grow this moustache just so people will recognise me.

259
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,960
这些年来  我很荣幸能够记录
"Over the many years it has been my privilege to record

260
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,140
我非凡的朋友夏洛克·福尔摩斯先生的功绩
"the exploits of my remarkable friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes,

261
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,390
在其众多的案件中择一呈现给读者
"It has sometimes been difficult to choose which of his many cases

262
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,420
有时并非易事
"to set before my readers.

263
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,860
有些过于敏感  不便详述
"Some are still too sensitive to recount,

264
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,970
而有些则尚未淡出公众脑海
"whilst others are too recent in the minds of the public.

265
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,800
但在我们共同经历的众多冒险中
"But in all our many adventures together,

266
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
还没有哪件案子
no case pushed my friend

267
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,850
像《恐怖新娘》那样
to such mental and physical extremes

268
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,350
挑战了我朋友的心理及生理极限
"as that of The Abominable Bride!"

269
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,170
老天爷
Good Lord!

270
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,040
赫德森太太  我的客厅里有个女人
Mrs Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room!

271
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,760
这是故意的吗
Is it intentional?

272
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,450
她是客户
She's a client.

273
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,370
我说你出去了  她坚持要等
Said you were out, insisted on waiting.

274
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,790
你想坐下吗
Would you, er, care to sit down?

275
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,640
你有没有问她想要什么
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?

276
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,220
你去问她
You ask her!

277
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,940
你为什么不问她
Why didn't you ask her?

278
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,350
我怎么问  我又不说话
How could I, what with me not talking and everything?!

279
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,370
老天爷啊  给她点台词
For God's sake, give her some lines,

280
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,300
她完全可以把我们饿死
she's perfectly capable of starving us!

281
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,160
下午好  我是夏洛克·克福尔摩斯
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes,

282
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,140
这是我的朋友兼同事  华生医生
this is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.

283
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,150
你可以在他面前畅所欲言
You may speak freely in front of him,

284
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,010
-因为他基本听不懂  -福尔摩斯
- as he rarely understands a word. - Holmes!

285
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,780
但在你开口之前
However, before you do,

286
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,990
请容我先说一些我小小的观察
allow me to make some trifling observations.

287
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,570
你有一种恶作剧般的幽默感
You have an impish sense of humour,

288
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,930
你现在就在以此
which currently you are deploying

289
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,400
减轻你个人的痛苦
to ease a degree of personal anguish.

290
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,570
你最近嫁给了一个
You have recently married a man

291
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,640
看起来性格很好的人
of a seemingly kindly disposition,

292
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,660
而他现在因为一个
who has now abandoned you

293
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,300
品行有问题的同伴而抛弃了你
for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.

294
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,610
你把来到这里当做最后的手段
You have come to this agency as a last resort,

295
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,000
以期你们的关系可以得到调解
in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.

296
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,490
我的天啊  福尔摩斯
Good Lord, Holmes!

297
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,250
当然  所有这些都是从你的香水推测而来
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.

298
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,370
她的香水
Her perfume?

299
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,920
对  香水  让我洞悉一切  给你带来灾难
Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.

300
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,900
为什么
How so?

301
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,090
因为我认出了它
Because I recognised it

302
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,870
而你没有
and you did not.

303
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,160
-玛丽  -约翰
- Mary! - John.

304
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,620
我的天  你为什么要扮成客户
Why, in God's name, are you pretending to be a client?

305
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,020
因为我想不出别的办法能见我丈夫  丈夫
Because I could think of no other way to see my husband, husband.

306
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,800
那是个国际阴谋事件
It was an affair of international intrigue.

307
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
就是个被谋杀的乡绅
It was a murdered country squire.

308
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
虽然如此  但事情紧急
Nevertheless, matters were pressing.

309
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
我不介意你走  亲爱的
I don't mind you going, my darling,

310
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,170
-我介意的是你扔下我  -但你能做什么
- I mind you leaving me behind. - But what could you do?!

311
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,220
那你能做什么
Well, what do you do,

312
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,190
除了晃来晃去做笔记  表现得很惊讶
except wander around taking notes, looking surprised?!

313
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,130
够了
Enough!

314
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,850
舞台已经准备好  大幕升起
The stage is set, the curtain rises.

315
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,310
我们要开始了
We are ready to begin.

316
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,580
开始什么
Begin what?

317
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,360
有时为了破一个案子  必须先破另一个
Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.

318
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,960
你有案子吗  一个新案子
Oh, you have a case, then, a new one?

319
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,860
一个老案子  非常老
An old one, very old.

320
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,390
我必须得深入
I shall have to go deep.

321
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,920
深入什么
Deep? Into what?

322
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,710
我自己
Myself.

323
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,610
雷斯垂德  别在门外晃了  进来吧
Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.

324
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,950
你怎么知道是我
How did you know it was me?

325
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,970
脚步声是不会错的
The regulation tread is unmistakable.

326
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,330
比琼斯轻  被格雷格森重
Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.

327
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,910
我刚上来  哈德森太太不肯说话
I, I just came up... Mrs Hudson didn't seem to be talking.

328
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,440
恐怕她是在用讽刺的方法
I fear she has branched into literary criticism

329
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,860
进行文学批评
by means of satire.

330
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,290
这是现代房东烦人的发展趋势
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.

331
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,040
你为何事在下班时间过来
What brings you here in your off-duty hours?

332
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
-你怎么知道我下班了  -从你来之后
- How do you know I'm off duty? - Well, since your arrival,

333
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,520
你超过40%的注意力都在我的酒瓶上
you've addressed over 40% of your remarks to my decanter.

334
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,950
华生  给探长拿点他显然想要的东西
Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.

335
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,220
雷斯垂德  我们能为你做什么
So...Lestrade, what can we do for you?

336
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,490
我不是为公事来的  我只是想过来看看
Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.

337
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,490
社交拜访吗
A social call?

338
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,050
当然  只是想给你带来节日问候
Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.

339
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,810
-圣诞快乐  -圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

340
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,510
-圣诞快乐  -圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

341
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,250
可算客套完了
Thank God that's over.

342
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,190
说吧  探长  是什么奇怪的事让你来到我家
Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door,

343
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,010
又让你尴尬得说不出口
but embarrasses you to relate?

344
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,970
谁说出事了
Who said anything happened?

345
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,240
你  虽然你没有真正说出来
You did. By every means short of actual speech.

346
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,670
福尔摩斯  你误判了
Holmes, you have misdiagnosed.

347
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,550
那纠正我一下  医生
Then, correct me, Doctor.

348
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,780
他不是想要喝一杯  而是需要喝一杯
He didn't want a drink, he needed one.

349
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,490
他不是尴尬  他是害怕
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.

350
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,410
我的传记作者学到了东西  他们进步得真快
My Boswell is learning. They do grow up so fast.

351
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,140
华生  给苏格兰场恢复一下勇气
Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard.

352
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,650
探长  坐下吧
Inspector, do sit down.

353
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,880
我并不是害怕
I'm, I'm not afraid, exactly.

354
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,010
恐惧是面对危险时的智慧
Fear is wisdom in the face of danger,

355
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,740
这没什么难为情的
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

356
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,030
谢谢
Thank you.

357
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,290
从头开始讲吧
From the beginning, then.

358
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,390
你
You!

359
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,600
不要  拜托
No, please!

360
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,260
你
You?!

361
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,190
等一下
A moment.

362
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,080
这是什么时候的事
When was this?

363
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,600
昨天早上
Yesterday morning.

364
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,490
那个新娘的脸  是怎样描述的
The bride's face, how was it described?

365
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,980
"像死人一样苍白  嘴像一道绯红的伤口"
"White as death, mouth like a crimson wound."

366
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,280
这是创作还是事实
Poetry or truth?

367
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,870
很多人会说它们是一样的
Many would say they're the same thing.

368
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,630
对  他们都是白痴  创作还是事实
Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?

369
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,170
我看到过她的脸  是在后来
I saw her face myself. Afterwards.

370
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,750
什么的后来
After what?

371
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,820
你
You?

372
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,760
还是我
Or me?

373
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,160
不是吧  雷斯垂德  一个女人当众饮弹
Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman blows her own brains out in public

374
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,600
而你需要我帮助找出罪犯
and you need help identifying the guilty party?

375
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,650
恐怕苏格兰场又刷低了下限
I feel Scotland Yard has reached a new low.

376
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,340
那不是我来的原因
That's not why I'm here.

377
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,980
-我猜也是  -她叫什么名字  那个新娘
- I surmised. - What was her name, the bride?

378
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,460
艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂  昨天是她的结婚纪念日
Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday was her wedding anniversary.

379
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,800
当然  有人报了警
The police, of course, were called.

380
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,040
她的尸体被送到了停尸房
And her body taken to the morgue.

381
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,000
这是标准程序  你为什么要告诉我们这些
Standard procedure. Why are you telling us what may be presumed?

382
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,420
因为接下来发生的事
Because of what happened next.

383
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,640
在莱姆豪斯  就几小时之后
Limehouse. Just a few hours later.

384
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,780
托马斯·瑞克莱蒂  艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂的丈夫
Thomas Ricoletti. Emelia Ricoletti's husband.

385
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,450
大概是在去停尸房辨认遗体的路上吧
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains?

386
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,770
结果他省了这麻烦
As it turned out, he was saved the trip.

387
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,040
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

388
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,330
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

389
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,970
{\an8}*记住那少女*
*Remember the maid...*

390
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,650
你是谁
Who are you?

391
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,130
{\an8}*磨坊的少女*
*The maid of the mill...*

392
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,890
你为什么要这样做  告诉我你是谁
Why are you doing this? Just tell me who you are!

393
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,130
你听出了我们的歌吗  亲爱的
You recognise our song, my dear?

394
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,090
我在婚礼上唱过
I sang it at our wedding.

395
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,040
艾米丽娅
Emelia?

396
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,490
你死了  你不可能在这里  你死了
You, you're dead, you can't be here, you died!

397
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,230
我美吗  托马斯
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?

398
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,410
跟你娶我那天一样美
As beautiful as the day you married me?

399
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,300
-谁...  -这是怎么回事
- Who... - What the hell is all this about?!

400
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,720
看起来像是什么样  我英俊的朋友
What does it look like, my handsome friend?

401
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,500
这是"枪杆"下的婚姻
It's a shotgun wedding.

402
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,810
不至死亡  永不分离  他们各死了一次
Till death us do part. Twice in this case.

403
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,100
真离奇
Extraordinary.

404
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,380
不可能
Impossible.

405
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,720
太棒了
Superb.

406
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,520
在街头自杀  被尸体谋杀
Suicide as street theatre, murder by corpse.

407
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,710
雷斯垂德  你简直宠坏我们了
Lestrade, you're spoiling us.

408
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,860
华生  你的帽子和外套
Watson, your hat and coat.

409
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,020
-我们去哪里  -停尸房
- Where are we going? - To the morgue.

410
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,450
一刻也不能耽搁了
There's not a moment to lose,

411
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,030
很少有人会这样说停尸房
which one can so rarely say of a morgue.

412
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
那我就坐在这里吗
And am I just to sit here?

413
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,880
当然不是  亲爱的  我们之后会饿的
Not at all, my dear. We'll be hungry later.

414
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,490
福尔摩斯  有个问题  穿花呢衣服去停尸房吗
Holmes, just one thing, tweeds in a morgue?

415
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,860
没时间换衣服了  华生
Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.

416
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
太太
Ma'am.

417
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,720
我参与了一项活动
I'm part of a campaign, you know.

418
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,050
活动
Oh, campaign?

419
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,720
为女性争取投票权
Votes for women.

420
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,840
你是支持还是反对
And are you for or against?

421
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,400
出去
Get out.

422
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,670
他们又走了  对吧
Have they gone off again, have they?

423
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,630
那些绅士过着什么样的生活啊
I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.

424
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,400
是啊  那些绅士
Yes. Those gentlemen!

425
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,260
算了
Never you mind.

426
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,040
差点忘了  这是给你的
Almost forgot, that came for you.

427
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,770
赫德森太太  告诉我丈夫我会晚归
Mrs Hudson, tell my husband I'll be home late,

428
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,890
我有些急事
I have some urgent business.

429
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,230
一切还好吧
Is everything all right?

430
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,230
只是一个需要帮助的朋友
Oh, you know, just a, er, friend in need.

431
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,280
天啊  什么朋友
Oh, dear. What friend?

432
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,160
英格兰
England.

433
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,020
还真是含糊
Well, that's not very specific.

434
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,810
停尸房谁当班
Who's on mortuary duty?

435
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,020
你知道的
You know who.

436
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,370
总是他
Always him.

437
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,710
拜托告诉我是哪个傻瓜干的
Please tell me which idiot did this!

438
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,690
这是为了大家的安全
It's for everyone's safety.

439
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,960
这女人死了  她半边头都不见了
This woman is dead, half her head is missing.

440
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,640
她对谁都不是威胁
She's not a threat to anyone.

441
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,660
跟她的丈夫说去吧  他在那边的罩单下
Tell that to her husband, he's under a sheet over there.

442
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,990
不管昨晚在莱姆豪斯发生了什么
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night,

443
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,110
我们能断定那不是一个死去的女人干的
I think we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman.

444
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,640
比这更奇怪的事都发生过
Stranger things have happened.

445
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,210
比如呢
Such as...?

446
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,550
奇怪的事
Well... Strange things.

447
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,080
你说话跟小孩一样
You're speaking like a child.

448
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,190
这显然是活人干的  他在哪里
This is clearly man's work. Where is he?

449
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,750
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

450
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
霍普
Hooper.

451
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,210
你  继续工作
You, back to work!

452
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,880
你是来用魔术震撼我们了吧
So, come to astonish us with your magic tricks, I suppose?

453
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,040
你想提醒我注意什么事吗
Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?

454
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,820
完全没有  福尔摩斯先生
Nothing at all, Mr Holmes.

455
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,940
你想什么时候走都行
You may leave any time you like.

456
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,360
霍普医生  是我请福尔摩斯先生来的  合作点
Dr Hooper, I asked Mr Holmes to come here. Cooperate.

457
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,580
这是命令
That's an order.

458
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,490
有两点"值得注意"
There are two "Features of interest",

459
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,150
正如你在华生医生的故事里经常说的
as you are always saying in Dr Watson's stories.

460
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,240
我从来没说过
I never say that.

461
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,780
你说过  很多次
You do, actually, quite a lot.

462
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,630
首先  这绝对是艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂
First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.

463
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,440
她已经被确定身份了
She has been categorically identified.

464
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,630
这肯定是她  无可置疑
Beyond a doubt, it is her.

465
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,570
那昨晚在莱姆豪斯是谁
Then who was that in Limehouse last night?

466
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,600
也是艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.

467
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,030
不可能  她死了  躺在这里
It can't have been. She was dead, she was here.

468
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,410
是她自己的丈夫
She was positively identified

469
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,930
在死去的前几秒确认的
by her own husband, seconds before he died.

470
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,690
他没理由撒谎  几乎不可能搞错
He had no reason to lie, could hardly have been mistaken.

471
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,320
车夫也认识她  那就是她
The cabbie knew her, too, there's no question it's her.

472
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,340
但她不可能同时出现在两个地方  对吧
But she can't have been in two places at the same time, can she?

473
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,140
不  华生  对于刚死的人来说
No, Watson, one place is strictly the limit

474
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,580
他们只能去一个地方
for the recently deceased.

475
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,570
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

476
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,540
-可能是双胞胎吗  -不
- Could it have been twins? - No.

477
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,240
为什么
Why not?

478
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,140
因为从来都不是双胞胎
Because it's never twins.

479
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,330
艾米丽娅没有双胞胎  也没有姐妹
Emelia was not a twin, nor did she have any sisters.

480
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,940
她有一个哥哥  四年前去世了
She had one older brother who died four years ago.

481
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,690
也许是秘密的双胞胎
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.

482
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,110
什么
A what?!

483
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,300
秘密的双胞胎
A secret twin.

484
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,680
知道吗
Hmm? You know?

485
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,080
没人知道的双胞胎
A twin that nobody knows about.

486
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,730
这一切可能是策划好的
This whole thing could have been planned.

487
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,690
从怀孕时开始
Since the moment of conception.

488
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,720
她真是太有先见之明了
How breathtakingly prescient of her.

489
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,700
从来不是双胞胎  华生
It is never twins, Watson!

490
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,810
那你怎么看
Then what's your theory?

491
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,540
更重要的是  你什么毛病
More to the point, what's your problem?

492
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,310
-我不明白  -你为什么这么害怕
- I, I don't understand... - Why were you so frightened?

493
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,800
到现在为止  没什么能说明你为什么要喝酒
Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter,

494
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,250
还有为什么允许一个死去的女人被逮捕
and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?

495
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,190
因为还有一点"值得注意"
Ah, that would be the other feature of interest.

496
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,500
她指尖上有一些血迹
A smear of blood on her finger.

497
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,610
血迹的由来可以有多种解释
That could have happened any number of ways.

498
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,820
没错
Indeed.

499
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,940
还有一点
There's one other thing.

500
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,070
之前没有血迹
It wasn't there earlier.

501
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,510
那个也是新的
Neither was that.

502
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,210
你
You!

503
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,510
你
You?

504
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,370
你
You?!

505
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,360
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

506
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,560
吞枪自尽  子弹贯穿头部...
Gun in the mouth, a bullet through the brain...

507
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,730
后脑被轰掉
Back of the head blown clean off.

508
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,460
他是怎么活下来的
How could he survive?

509
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,110
你是说"她"吧
"She", you mean.

510
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,070
什么
I'm sorry?

511
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,490
不是"他"  是"她"
Not "He", "She".

512
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,380
是  当然了
Yes, yes of course.

513
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,700
谢谢你们给了我这么吸引人的案子
Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.

514
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,430
我破案之后会给你们发电报的  华生
I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it. Watson.

515
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,330
死因明显是枪伤
The gunshot wound was obviously the cause of death,

516
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,370
但同时有肺痨的明显迹象
but there are clear indicators of consumption.

517
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,710
还是验一下尸吧
It might be worth a postmortem.

518
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,610
我们需要所有能收集到的线索
We need all the information we can get.

519
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,620
老爸一走  他就开始显摆观察力了
Oh, isn't he observant, now that Daddy's gone

520
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,820
我在某些方面观察力确实很强
I am observant in some ways,

521
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,330
就像福尔摩斯在某些方面没有眼力见一样
just as Holmes is quite blind in others.

522
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,170
-是吗  -没错
- Really? - Yes, really.

523
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,930
为了混进男人的天下  也是蛮拼的啊
Amazing...what one has to do to get ahead in a man's world.

524
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,180
他这话什么意思
What's he saying that for?

525
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,390
干你的活儿去
Get back to work!

526
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,260
说吧  福尔摩斯  你肯定有些想法吧
Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory?

527
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,460
还没有
Not yet.

528
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,430
此案非常复杂  华生  很棘手
These are deep waters, Watson, deep waters.

529
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,760
但我还得继续深入
And I shall have to go deeper still.

530
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,050
几个月后  我们才又继续
It was not for several months that we were to pick up

531
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,530
调查这件奇案
the threads of this strange case again.

532
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,630
还是在出乎意料的情况之下
And then under very unexpected circumstances.

533
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,360
现在已经五起案子了  每起都一样
Five of them now, all the same, every one of them.

534
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,900
请安静  这件事事关重大
Hush, please, this is a matter of supreme importance.

535
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,760
-什么  -黄赤交角
- What is? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

536
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,900
我必须要理解它
I have to understand it.

537
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,590
什么东西
What is it?

538
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,960
不知道  我还在努力弄懂它
I don't know, I'm still trying to understand it.

539
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,670
-我以为你无所不知  -当然不是了
- I thought you understood everything. - Of course not,

540
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,260
那多浪费我大脑的记忆空间
that would be an appalling waste of brain space.

541
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,310
我是专攻类型的
I specialise.

542
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,580
这事为什么重要
And what's so important about this?

543
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,740
五起无聊的谋杀案又怎么重要了
What's so important about five boring murders?

544
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,220
这可不无聊  五个男人被害
They're not boring. Five men dead,

545
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,730
死在家中  地上洒满了生米
murdered in their own homes, rice on the floor

546
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,540
就像在婚礼上一样
like at a wedding,

547
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,390
墙上用血着"你"
and the word "You" written in blood on the wall!

548
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,080
是她  那个鬼新娘
It's, it's her, it's the Bride.

549
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,100
她又复活了
Somehow she's risen again.

550
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,010
解决了
Solved it.

551
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,410
你怎么就破案了
You can't have solved it!

552
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,210
我当然破了  非常简单
Of course I've solved it, it's perfectly simple.

553
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,860
神秘的瑞克莱蒂太太事件
The incident of the mysterious Mrs Ricoletti,

554
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,090
这位来自阴间的凶手
the killer from beyond the grave,

555
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,830
被媒体大肆渲染
has been widely reported in the popular press.

556
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,060
现在有人将自己实施的谋杀
Now people are disguising their own dull little murders

557
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,280
伪装成是鬼魂杀人
as the work of a ghost,

558
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,200
借此迷惑愚蠢的苏格兰场
to confuse the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.

559
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,450
瞧  我破案了
There you are, solved.

560
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,150
你走前跟赫德森太太聊一下
Pay Mrs Hudson a visit on your way out,

561
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,700
她喜欢有参与感
she likes to feel involved.

562
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,810
你确定
You sure?

563
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,450
确定  你走吧
Certainly. Go away.

564
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,280
华生  我准备好了
Watson! I'm ready.

565
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,690
戴好帽子穿好鞋  我们有个重要约会
Your hat and boots, we have an important appointment.

566
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,480
华生医生几个月前不是搬走了吗
Didn't Dr Watson move out a few months ago?

567
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,640
他确实搬走了  对吧
He did, didn't he?

568
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,190
那我一直是在跟谁说话来着
Who have I been talking to all this time?

569
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,670
我代表愚蠢至极的苏格兰场说一句
Well, speaking on behalf of the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,

570
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,390
那张椅子上没人
that chair is definitely empty.

571
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,010
确实没人吧
It is, isn't it?

572
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,650
但我这些日子过得挺不错的
Works surprisingly well, though.

573
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,520
我还以为他有进步了
I actually thought he was improving.

574
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,000
你去哪了
Where have you been?

575
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,800
抱歉  老爷  我今早有些迟了
Sorry, sir, I'm rather behind my time this morning.

576
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,810
你连蛋都不会煮吗
Are you incapable of boiling an egg?!

577
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,240
炉里没有火  到处是灰尘
The fires are rarely lit, there is dust everywhere

578
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,080
你清理我靴子上的泥时差点毁了那双鞋
and you almost destroyed my boots scraping the mud off them.

579
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,300
如果不是我妻子掌管佣人的事
If it wasn't my wife's business to deal with the staff,

580
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,430
我会亲自管教你
I would talk to you myself.

581
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,620
我妻子人呢
Where is my wife?

582
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,570
很抱歉  老爷  夫人出去了
Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out.

583
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,940
这么早就出门了吗
Out? At this hour of the morning?

584
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,960
是的  老爷  您不知道吗  老爷
Yes, sir. Did you not know that, sir?

585
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,130
她去哪了  她最近总出去
Where did she go? She's always out these days.

586
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,620
您不也是  老爷
Not unlike yourself...sir.

587
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,740
什么
I'm sorry...?

588
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,050
-就是说说我的观察  老爷  -够了
- Just observing, sir. - Well, that's quite enough,

589
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,250
谁让你观察的
nobody asked you to be observant.

590
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,140
抱歉  老爷  我就是说
Sorry, sir, I just meant

591
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,160
你们很少一起待在家里了
you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.

592
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,550
你的言行近乎无礼
You are dangerously close to impertinence.

593
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,020
我要跟我妻子谈下  让她管教下你了
I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.

594
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,920
好  老爷  那您什么时候见她呢
Very good, sir. And when will you be seeing her?

595
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,060
-听着...  -我差点忘了  老爷
- Now, listen... - Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.

596
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,190
-有封您的电报  -你忘了
- A telegram came for you. - You forgot?!

597
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,650
没有  只是差点忘了
No, I nearly forgot.

598
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,050
你一上午都在干什么
What have you been doing all morning?

599
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,160
读您《斯特兰德月刊》上的新文章  老爷
Reading your new one in The Strand, sir.

600
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,190
你喜欢吗
Did you enjoy it?

601
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,830
您为什么从不提我  老爷
Why do you never mention me, sir?

602
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,680
下去吧
Go away.

603
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,640
-什么的什么  -黄赤交角
- The what of the what? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

604
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,020
你说"速来"  我以为是很重要的事
"Come at once," You said. I assumed it was important.

605
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,590
是很重要  那是地球的赤道面
It is. It's the inclination of the earth's equator

606
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,940
与其绕太阳运行的轨道平面的夹角
to the path of the sun on the celestial plane.

607
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,690
你是刚学的吧
You been swotting up?

608
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,040
-我为什么要这么做  -为了显得聪明
- Why would I do that? - To sound clever.

609
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,260
-我本就聪明  -我懂了
- I am clever. - Oh, oh, I see.

610
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,540
懂什么了
You see what?

611
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,950
我推理我们是要去见某个比你聪明的人
I deduce we're on our way to see someone cleverer than you.

612
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,240
闭嘴
Shut up.

613
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,020
什么
Sorry, what?

614
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,290
对想研究人类的人来说  这里最合适
To anyone who wishes to study mankind, this is the spot.

615
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,180
也很方便  毕竟你那不断扩张的屁股
Handy really, as your ever-expanding backside

616
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,420
永远粘在了这里
is permanently glued to it.

617
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,390
早上好  我的哥哥  
Good morning, brother mine.

618
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,620
夏洛克  华生医生
Sherlock. Dr Watson.

619
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,370
您看上去  很不错  先生
You look...well, sir.

620
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,860
真的吗  我觉得我看上去很巨大
Really? I rather thought I looked enormous.

621
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,700
既然您提到了  这种程度的暴饮暴食
Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption

622
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,190
对您的健康危害极大
is incredibly injurious to your health.

623
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,070
-您的心脏  -不用担心那个  华生
- Your heart... - No need to worry on that score, Watson.

624
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,190
-不吗  -那个器官只会待在一个宽敞的地方
- No? - There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.

625
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,030
-家族通病  -我不是故意说话尖刻
- It's a family trait. - Oh, I wasn't being critical.

626
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,260
如果您继续这样  先生
If you continue like this, sir,

627
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,420
我觉得您最多能活五年
I give you five years at the most.

628
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,520
五年  我们觉得也就是三年  
Five? We thought three,

629
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,490
对吧  夏洛克
did we not, Sherlock?

630
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,630
我还是倾向于四年
I'm still inclined to four.

631
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,320
还是这样  你看到了却不懂观察
As ever, you see but you do not observe.

632
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,170
注意我眼白的颜色发生了变化
Note the discolouration in the whites of my eyes,

633
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,480
角膜周围出现可见的脂肪圈
the visible rings of fat around the corneas.

634
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,740
你是对的  我改赌三年
Yes, you're right. I'm changing my bet to three years,

635
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,330
-四个月零十一天  -打赌
- four months and 11 days. - A bet?!

636
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,980
我理解你不赞同  华生
I understand your disapproval, Watson,

637
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,210
但他好胜心强
but if he's feeling competitive,

638
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,260
可以自己控制早点死亡
it's perfectly within his power to die early.

639
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,980
这也是要冒的风险
That's a risk you'll have to take.

640
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,730
你在拿自己的性命打赌
You're gambling with your own life?

641
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,750
为什么不  比拿别人的命打赌有意思多了
Why not? It's so much more exciting than gambling with others'.

642
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,680
整三年  如果你吃了那个葡萄干布丁的话
Three years flat - if you eat that plum pudding!

643
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,230
就这么定了
Done.

644
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,160
我以为几天前会因为领主庄园的案子见到你呢
I expected to see you a few days ago about the Manor House case.

645
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,170
我觉得那案子你会有点力不从心
I thought you might be a little out of your depth there.

646
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,590
没有  我解决了
No. I solved it.

647
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,080
-肯定是亚当斯  -是亚当斯
- It was Adams, of course. - Yes, it was Adams.

648
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,580
嫉妒杀人
Murderous jealousy.

649
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,060
他给皇家天文学会写了一篇
He'd written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society

650
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,230
关于黄赤交角的论文
on the obliquity of the ecliptic,

651
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,330
然后又读到另一篇
and then read another

652
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,930
比他写的好的
that seemed to surpass it.

653
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,890
我知道  我读了
I know, I read it.

654
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,170
你看明白了吗
Did you understand it?

655
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,540
我当然明白了  很浅显易懂
Yes, of course I understood it, it was perfectly simple.

656
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,940
不是  你明白嫉妒杀人吗
No, did you understand the murderous jealousy?

657
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,240
一个伟大的大脑
It is no easy thing

658
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,450
去考虑一个更伟大的大脑可不容易
for a great mind to contemplate a still greater one.

659
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,330
你召我来就是为了羞辱我吗
Did you summon me here just to humiliate me?

660
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,460
是的
Yes.

661
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,060
当然不是  但这是最大的乐趣
Of course not, but it is by far the greater pleasure.

662
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,640
那你能不能解释下为什么要召
Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon...?

663
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,820
我们的生活方式受到了一个无形敌人的威胁
Our way of life is under threat from an invisible enemy.

664
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,930
他们每天都常伴我们身边
One that hovers at our elbow on a daily basis.

665
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,900
这些敌人无处不在
These enemies are everywhere...

666
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,810
无人发现
undetected...

667
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,430
无法阻止
and unstoppable.

668
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,790
社会主义者
Socialists?

669
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,320
不是社会主义者  医生  不是
Not socialists, Doctor, no.

670
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,590
-无政府主义者  -不是
- Anarchists? - No.

671
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,960
法国人  妇女参政权论者
The French? The suffragists?

672
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,760
还有什么大规模团体是你不担心的吗
Is there any large body of people you're not concerned about?

673
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,720
华生医生永远心怀警惕  详说
Dr Watson is endlessly vigilant. Elaborate...

674
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,060
不  去调查
No. Investigate.

675
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,700
这是我的推测  我需要你去证实
This is a conjecture of mine, I need you to confirm it.

676
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,280
我给你个案子
I'm sending you a case.

677
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,290
-苏格兰人  -苏格兰人
- The Scots? - The Scots?!

678
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,310
你是否知道最近
Are you aware of recent theories concerning

679
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,740
关于妄想症的理论
what is known as paranoia?

680
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,360
听着像是塞尔维亚人
Oh, sounds Serbian.

681
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,280
会有个女人去找你  卡迈克夫人
A woman will call on you. Lady Carmichael.

682
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,650
你得接她的案子
I want you to take her case.

683
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,560
但这些敌人  如果你不告诉我们
But these enemies, how are we to defeat them

684
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,930
我们怎么打败他们
if you won't tell us about them?

685
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,770
我们不会打败他们  
We don't defeat them.

686
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,840
我们几乎绝对要输给他们
We most certainly lose to them.

687
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,320
为什么
Why?

688
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,800
因为他们是正确的  我们是错的
Because they are right. And we are wrong.

689
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,830
卡迈克夫人的案子  是什么
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it?

690
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,360
放心  会有值得你注意的地方
Rest assured, it has features of interest.

691
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,610
-我从没这么说过  -你真说过
- I never really say that. - You really do.

692
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,200
我估计你已经解决了
And you've solved it already, I assume?

693
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,320
只是设想而已  我要你去跑腿
Only in my head. I need you for the, er, legwork.

694
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,100
为什么不告诉我们你的答案
Why not just tell us your solution?

695
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,940
那还有什么意思呢
And where would be the sport in that?

696
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,410
你愿意接吗  夏洛克
Will you do it, Sherlock?

697
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,990
这绝对是极好的消遣
I can promise you a superior distraction.

698
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,460
我有一个条件  你再吃一个葡萄干布丁
On one condition. Have another plum pudding.

699
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,740
本来就准备吃了
There's one on the way.

700
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,360
两年十一个月四天
Two years, 11 months and four days.

701
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,820
开始好玩喽  滴答  滴答  滴答
Ha, it's getting exciting now! Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

702
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,330
谢谢  怀尔德
Thank you, Wilder.

703
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,300
有一位梅尔斯先生要见你  福尔摩斯先生
Also, a Mr Melas to see you, Mr Holmes.

704
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,510
等我五分钟  我还有一场赌局要赢呢
Give me five minutes, I have a wager to win.

705
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,890
还是十五分钟吧
Better make that 15.

706
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,640
滴答
Ticktock.

707
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,790
福尔摩斯先生  我是来请您出主意的
Mr Holmes, I have come here for advice.

708
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,040
-这个不难  -还有您的帮助
- That is easily got. - And help.

709
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,510
这就未必容易了
Not always so easy.

710
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:06,110
有古怪的事发生了  福尔摩斯先生
Something has happened, Mr Holmes, something...unusual

711
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,670
而且很可怕
and...terrifying.

712
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,970
那你真是太幸运了
Then you are in luck.

713
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,970
幸运吗
Luck?!

714
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,820
那是我的专长  真的是很有前途啊
Those are my specialisms. This is really very promising.

715
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,910
福尔摩斯...
Holmes...

716
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,540
请说说  您究竟在担忧什么
Please...do tell us what has so distressed you.

717
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,070
我想了很久该怎么办
I, I thought long and hard as to what to do,

718
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,980
后来突然想起  我丈夫
but then it occurred to me that my husband was

719
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,860
是您哥哥相识  也许通过他...
an acquaintance of your brother and that perhaps through him...

720
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,650
其实我也不确定
The fact is, I'm not sure

721
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,200
这事是否该找您  福尔摩斯先生
this comes within your purview, Mr Holmes.

722
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,970
是吗
No?

723
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,760
天啊  这或许是驱魔牧师的事
Lord help me, I think it may be a matter for a priest.

724
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,560
你的晨间危机是什么  亲爱的
And what does your morning threaten, my dear?

725
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,540
绣花绣得停不下来
A vigorous round of embroidering?

726
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,380
还是跟女帽匠频繁的见面
An exhausting appointment at the milliners?

727
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,460
你就爱戏弄我  尤斯塔斯
I hope you are teasing, Eustace.

728
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,360
怎么了
What is it?

729
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,490
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

730
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,630
丹尼尔  索菲  出去玩会儿
Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.

731
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,320
妈妈...
But, Mama...

732
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,960
听话  快去
Look, do as I tell you, quickly now.

733
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,680
尤斯塔斯  这是什么意思
Well, Eustace, what does this mean?

734
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,740
死亡
Death.

735
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,230
什么
What?

736
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,320
这意味着死亡
It means death.

737
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,680
没什么  没什么
Er, nothing, it's, it's nothing.

738
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,040
我弄错了
I was...mistaken.

739
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,200
亲爱的  你的脸色怎么这么苍白
My dear, you've gone quite pale.

740
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,410
没事的
It's nothing!

741
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,280
尤斯塔斯
Eustace...

742
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,700
信封您留着吗
Did you keep the envelope?

743
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,760
被我丈夫毁了  但上面什么也没有
My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.

744
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,420
没有姓名  地址  任何信息
No name or address of any kind.

745
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,460
尤斯塔斯爵士在美国待过吗
Tell me, has Sir Eustace spent time in America?

746
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,650
-没有  -你们结婚前也没有吗
- No. - Not even before your marriage?

747
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,140
据我所知没有
Well, not to my knowledge.

748
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,660
请您继续往下说吧
Pray, continue with your fascinating narrative.

749
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,330
这是上周一早上的事
Well, that incident took place last Monday morning.

750
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,430
两天后的周三
It was two days later on the Wednesday

751
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,200
我丈夫第一次看见了她
that my husband first saw her.

752
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,070
谁
Who?

753
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,880
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

754
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,620
她来找我了  路易莎 
She's come for me, Louisa!

755
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,990
天啊  帮帮我  我的罪来找我了
Oh, God, help me, my sins have found me out!

756
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,780
谁来找你了  尤斯塔斯  你吓到我了
Who's come for you? Eustace, you're frightening me.

757
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,910
看啊  看啊
Well, look, look!

758
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,080
你没看见吗
Don't you see her?

759
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,480
我什么也没看见
No, I see no-one.

760
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,970
走了
Gone.

761
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,100
你对我隐瞒了那么多秘密  这是另一个吗
You keep so many secrets from me, is this another?

762
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,560
你看到了谁
Who have you seen?

763
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,360
是她
It was her!

764
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,150
是鬼新娘
It was the Bride!

765
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,190
而您什么也没看见
And you saw nothing?

766
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,250
是的
Nothing.

767
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,180
-您丈夫描述过...  -没有  直到今早
- Did your husband describe...? - Nothing, until this morning.

768
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,920
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

769
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,020
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

770
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,490
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

771
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,160
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

772
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,170
该死
Blast!

773
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,350
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

774
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,830
你在哪  是我
Where are you? It's me!

775
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,970
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

776
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,370
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

777
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,250
*记住那少女*
*Remember the maid*

778
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,730
*磨坊的少女*
*he maid of the mill*

779
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,650
你是谁
Who are you?

780
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,250
我命令你  报上姓名
I demand you speak, who are you?!

781
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,440
尤斯塔斯  跟我说说话  天啊
Eustace, speak to me. In the name of God!

782
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,140
她是...
She's...

783
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,210
她是艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂
She is Emelia Ricoletti.

784
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,250
不  不是你
No, not you.

785
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,470
不
No...

786
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,820
求你了
Please!

787
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,590
今晚  尤斯塔斯·卡迈克
This night, Eustace Carmichael,

788
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,370
你将必死
you will die!

789
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,520
-福尔摩斯  -别说话  华生
- Holmes? - Hush, Watson.

790
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,680
艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂  那个新娘
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.

791
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,780
-你知道她  -请原谅华生
- Well, you know the name? - You must forgive Watson,

792
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,220
他就喜欢说出一些显而易见的事实
he has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious,

793
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,270
近乎狂热
which borders on mania.

794
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,210
容我问一句  您丈夫今早怎么样
May I ask, how is your husband this morning?

795
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,140
他不肯谈这件事
He refuses to speak about the matter.

796
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,400
当然了  我敦促他离开家
Obviously, I have urged him to leave the house.

797
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,940
不不  他得待在家里
No, no, he must stay exactly where he is.

798
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,320
你不认为他有生命危险吗
Well, you don't think he's in danger?

799
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,060
当然有  是有人想要他的命
Oh, no, somebody definitely wants to kill him,

800
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,670
但这对我们是好事  没有饵就钓不到鱼
but that's good for us. You can't set a trap without bait.

801
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,970
我丈夫可不是诱饵  福尔摩斯先生
My husband is not bait, Mr Holmes.

802
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,530
如果我们做对了  他可以做诱饵
No, but he could be if we play our cards right.

803
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,960
听着  您现在立刻回家
Now, listen, you must go home immediately.

804
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,740
华生医生和我会乘下一班火车跟上
Dr. Watson and I will follow on the next train.

805
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
一刻也不能耽搁了
There's not a moment to lose,

806
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,230
尤斯塔斯爵士今晚就要死了
Sir Eustace is to die tonight.

807
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,760
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

808
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,220
我们也许该阻止此事
And we should...probably avoid that.

809
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,740
-一定要  -一定要避免
- Definitely. - Definitely avoid that.

810
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,060
我弟弟接了这案子  当然了 
Little brother has taken the case, of course.

811
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,450
那就拜托你留意情况了
I now rely on you to keep an eye on things,

812
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,740
但绝不能让他怀疑你在帮我
but he must never suspect you are working for me.

813
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,950
清楚了吗  华生
Are you clear on that, Watson?

814
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,460
你可以相信我  福尔摩斯先生
You can rely on me, Mr Holmes.

815
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,770
-你说会不会...  -不会
- You don't suppose... - No, I don't

816
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,620
你也不该这么想
and neither should you.

817
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,910
你不知道我要说什么
You don't know what I was going to say.

818
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,140
你是想说  可能有什么超自然的东西
You were about to suggest there may be some supernatural agency

819
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,760
牵扯其中  而我打算当面嘲笑你
involved in this matter. And I was about to laugh in your face.

820
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,040
可那个新娘  福尔摩斯
But the Bride, Holmes,

821
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,700
又是艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂
Emelia Ricoletti again.

822
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,380
一个死去的女人活过来了
A dead woman walking the earth.

823
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,150
-你真让我惊讶  华生  -是吗
- You amaze me, Watson. - I do?

824
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,590
你什么时候开始有想象力了
Since when have you had any kind of imagination?

825
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,290
或许是从我让读者相信
Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that

826
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,790
某个不道德的吸毒者是个绅士英雄开始
an unprincipled drug addict was some kind of gentleman hero.

827
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,630
是啊  说到这个  还真是了不起
Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive.

828
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,760
但你可以确信  这世上没有鬼
You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world.

829
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,570
除了我们自己想象的
Save those we make for ourselves.

830
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,750
抱歉  你说什么
Sorry, what did you say?

831
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,160
我们自己想象的鬼  是什么意思
Ghosts we make for ourselves, what do you mean?

832
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,060
梦游症
Somnambulism.

833
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,720
抱歉  什么
I beg your pardon?

834
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,540
我会梦游  就这样
I sleepwalk, that's all.

835
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,100
这再正常不过了
It's a common enough condition.

836
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,430
你不是医生吗
I thought you were a doctor!

837
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,500
这整件事就是一场噩梦
The whole thing was a...bad dream.

838
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,220
包括你收到的信封里的东西吗
Including the contents of the envelope you received?

839
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,790
那是个古怪的玩笑
Well, that's a grotesque joke.

840
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,930
你在你妻子面前的表现可并非如此  先生
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.

841
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,520
-她有癔病  会妄想  -不
- She's an hysteric, prone to fancies. - No.

842
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,040
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry, what did you say?

843
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,940
我说不  她没有癔病
I said no, she's not an hysteric.

844
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,250
她是个非常聪明的女人  有着少见的洞察力
She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.

845
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,170
我妻子从桔核里看出了恐惧
My wife sees terror in an orange pip.

846
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,130
你的妻子能在旁人看不见任何价值的地方
Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see

847
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,850
看出很多东西
anything of value whatsoever.

848
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,210
真的吗
Can she really?

849
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,370
那你是如何"推理"出来的呢  福尔摩斯先生
And how do you "Deduce" that, Mr Holmes?

850
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,740
她嫁给了你
She married you.

851
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,780
我想她一定有个合理的理由
I assume she was capable of finding a reason.

852
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,260
今晚我会尽力保护你的安全
I'll do my best to save your life tonight,

853
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,990
但如果你能解释一下
but first it would help

854
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,700
你和瑞克莱蒂一案的关系  会大有帮助
if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.

855
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,630
瑞克莱蒂
Ricoletti?

856
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,850
是的  拜托具体些
Yes. In detail, please.

857
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,890
我从没听说过她
I've never heard of her.

858
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,000
有意思  我没说瑞克莱蒂是个女人
Interesting. I didn't mention she was a woman.

859
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,930
我们告辞了  希望明早能再见到你
We'll show ourselves out. I hope to see you again in the morning.

860
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,570
不会的
You will not.

861
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,200
那真不幸  我就得破你的谋杀案了  日安
Then sadly I shall be solving your murder. Good day.

862
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,270
你尽力了
Well, you tried.

863
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,160
请把这个交给卡迈克夫人  谢谢
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this. Thank you.

864
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,260
-再见  -没问题  先生
- Good afternoon. - Certainly, sir.

865
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,570
那是什么
What was that?

866
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,950
卡迈克夫人今晚单独睡
Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight,

867
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,460
假装头痛难忍
upon the pretence of a violent headache.

868
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,500
整个宅子的门窗都要紧锁
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked.

869
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,330
你觉得那幽灵  鬼新娘
You think the spectre, er, Bride,

870
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,230
会试图再次把尤斯塔斯引到外面吗
will attempt to lure Sir Eustace outside again?

871
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,660
当然了  否则为什么放出威胁
Certainly. Why else the portentous threat?

872
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,100
"今晚  你将必死"
"This night you will die!"

873
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,780
但他不会跟她去吧
Well, he won't follow her, surely?

874
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,620
他会怎么做  很难说
Hmm, it's difficult to say quite what he'll do.

875
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,340
愧疚在吞噬他的灵魂
Guilt is eating away at his soul.

876
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,300
愧疚  关于什么
Guilt? About what?

877
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,920
他过去的某件事  那些桔核是一个提醒
Something in his past. The orange pips were a reminder.

878
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,660
-不是玩笑吗  -完全不是
- Not a joke? - Not at all.

879
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,240
桔核是传统中用来预警偿命的
Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death,

880
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,540
起源于美国
originating in America.

881
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,280
尤斯塔斯爵士对此再了解不过了
Sir Eustace knows this only too well,

882
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,950
他也很清楚自己为什么要受惩罚
just as he knows why he is to be punished.

883
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,080
和艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂有关吗
Something to do with Emelia Ricoletti?

884
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,910
我想是的
I presume.

885
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,100
我们都有过去  华生  有"鬼"
We all have a past, Watson. Ghosts.

886
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,610
它们是我们每个晴天里无法驱走的阴影
They are the shadows that define our every sunny day.

887
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,110
尤斯塔斯爵士知道自己逃不过了
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man.

888
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,460
他恐惧的不仅仅是死亡
There's something more than murder he fears.

889
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,100
他认为死去的瑞克莱蒂太太复活的尸体
He believes he is to be dragged to hell by the risen corpse

890
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,840
会把他拖进地狱
of the late Mrs Ricoletti.

891
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,190
这太荒谬了  不是吗
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?

892
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,080
老天  是啊  你的左轮手枪带了吗
God, yes. Did you bring your revolver?

893
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,530
手枪在幽灵面前有什么用
What good would that be against a ghost?

894
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,240
-对极了  你带了吗  -当然了
- Exactly. Did you bring it? - Yeah, of course.

895
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,990
那就来吧  华生  来吧
Then come, Watson, come.

896
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,770
游戏开始了
The game is afoot.

897
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,120
-蹲下  华生  老天爷  -抱歉  抽筋了
- Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake! - Sorry. Cramp.

898
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,810
-灯还亮着吗  -是的
- Is the lamp still burning? - Yes.

899
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,560
尤斯塔斯爵士的灯灭了
There goes Sir Eustace.

900
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,160
卡迈克夫人的也灭了
And Lady Carmichael.

901
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,980
宅子睡下了
The house sleeps.

902
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,130
老天  这是我这辈子最漫长的一夜了
Hmm, good God, this is the longest night of my life.

903
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,030
耐心点  华生
Have patience, Watson.

904
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,200
才到午夜
Only midnight.

905
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,450
我们很少这样坐在一起
You know, it's rare for us to sit together like this.

906
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,210
希望如此  我们在等待谋杀案
I should hope so. It's murder on the knees.

907
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,110
两个老朋友说着话  聊着天
Two old friends just talking. Chewing the fat.

908
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,410
男人对男人
Man-to-man.

909
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,050
非凡的女人
So, a remarkable woman.

910
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,940
-谁  -卡迈克夫人
- Who? - Lady Carmichael.

911
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,880
女性是你的专长  华生
The fair sex is your department, Watson.

912
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,940
你说什么就是什么
I'll take your word for it.

913
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,350
你挺喜欢她  "她有着少见的洞察力"
Well, you liked her. "A woman of rare perception."

914
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,970
和美妙的高足弓
And admirably high arches.

915
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,750
她一进房间  我就注意到了
I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.

916
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,990
-她太好了  他配不上  -你这么认为吗
- Huh, she's far too good for him. - You think so?

917
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,630
不  是你这么认为  我看得出来
No. You think so. I could tell.

918
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,650
恰恰相反  我对此毫无看法
On the contrary, I have no view on the matter.

919
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,750
不  你有
Yes, you have.

920
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,270
婚姻不是我会思考的问题
Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell.

921
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,030
-为什么  -你今晚是怎么回事
- Oh, why not? - What's the matter with you this evening?

922
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,410
你戴的那块表  里面有张照片
That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.

923
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,990
我瞥过一眼  我想那是艾琳·阿德勒
I glimpsed it once. I believe it is of Irene Adler.

924
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,030
你不只是瞥了一眼  你是等我睡着了
You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep

925
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,930
-才拿去看的  -是这样没错
- and looked at it. - Yes, I did.

926
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,610
-你真以为我不会发现吗  -艾琳·阿德勒
- You seriously thought I wouldn't notice? - Irene Adler.

927
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,920
一位强大的对手  一次了不起的冒险
Formidable opponent, a remarkable adventure.

928
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,890
-一张漂亮的照片  -你为什么要谈这些
- A very nice photograph. - Why are you talking like this?

929
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,370
你为什么坚决要独身
Why are you so determined to be alone?

930
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,610
你没事吧  华生
Are you quite well, Watson?

931
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,950
这问题就这么奇怪吗
Is it such a curious question?

932
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,350
对于维也纳精神病医生来说  不奇怪
From a Viennese alienist, no.

933
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,740
对于退役的军医来说  当然奇怪
From a retired army surgeon, most certainly.

934
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,510
福尔摩斯  我是毫无竞争对手的
Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever,

935
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,230
-你最亲密的朋友  -我承认
- I am your closest friend. - I concede it.

936
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,740
我现在是想和你
I am currently attempting to have a perfectly

937
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,120
再正常不过地交谈
normal conversation with you.

938
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,190
别这样
Please don't.

939
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,790
你为什么非要独身
Why do you need to be alone?

940
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,070
如果你指的是感情纠葛  华生
If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson,

941
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,730
恐怕你就是  正如我以前常说过的
which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before,

942
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,860
我憎恶一切感情
all emotion is abhorrent to me.

943
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,670
感情是干扰灵敏仪器的沙粒
It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.

944
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,920
-镜片上的裂纹  -镜片上的裂纹  对
- The crack in the lens. - The crack in the lens. Yes.

945
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,120
这就是了
Well, there you are, you see,

946
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,200
-我之前都说过  -不  这都是我写的
- I've said it all before. - No, I wrote all that.

947
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,210
你在援引《斯特兰德月刊》中你自己的话
You're quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.

948
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,040
说得对
Well, exactly.

949
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,580
那些是我的话  不是你的
Those are my words, not yours!

950
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,740
那是我向公众展示的你
That is the version of you that I present to the public.

951
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,170
没有感情的头脑  计算机器
The brain without a heart. The calculating machine.

952
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,070
那些都是我写的  福尔摩斯
I write all of that, Holmes,

953
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,590
读者们也欣然接受  但我不相信
and the readers lap it up. But I do not believe it.

954
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,890
我非常想给你的编辑写信
Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.

955
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,410
你是一个活生生的人
You are a living, breathing man.

956
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,070
-你也有生活  也有过去  -有什么
- You've lived a life, you have a past. - A what?!

957
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,950
-你肯定有过...  -有什么
- Well, you must have had... - Had what?

958
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,410
-你懂的  -不懂
- You know. - No.

959
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,400
经历
Experiences.

960
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,000
把左轮手枪递给我  我突然需要用一下
Pass me your revolver, I have a sudden need to use it.

961
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,800
见鬼  福尔摩斯  你也是血肉之躯
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood,

962
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,660
也有感情  你有...
you have feelings, you have...

963
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,830
你肯定有...冲动
You must have... impulses.

964
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,490
天啊  我从未如此盼望
Dear Lord, I have never been so impatient

965
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,260
被杀人不眨眼的鬼魂攻击
to be attacked by a murderous ghost.

966
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,390
作为你的朋友  作为担心你的人
As your friend, as someone who worries about you...

967
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,510
是什么让你变成这样的
What made you like this?

968
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,940
华生...
Oh, Watson...

969
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,630
没什么塑造了我
Nothing made me.

970
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,200
我塑造了自己
I made me.

971
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,030
红胡子
Redbeard?

972
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,910
我的天啊
Good God!

973
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,510
我们该怎么办
What are we to do?

974
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,280
我们去跟她聊聊吧
Why don't we have a chat?

975
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,080
是瑞克莱蒂太太吧
Mrs Ricoletti, I believe!

976
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,100
就这个时节来说  真是宜人的一晚
A pleasant night for the time of year, is it not?

977
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,200
这不可能  福尔摩斯  不可能
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

978
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,240
是不可能
No, it can't.

979
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,920
-锁上了  -按照要求锁着
- Is it locked? - As per instruction.

980
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,230
那是打破窗户的声音  是吗
That was a window breaking, wasn't it?

981
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,450
我们只需要担心一扇打破的窗户
There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with.

982
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,330
-待在这儿  华生  -什么  不
- Stay here, Watson. - What? No.

983
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,210
进出房子所有的门窗都锁着
All the doors and windows to the house are locked.

984
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,100
这是他们唯一的出口  我需要你在这儿守着
This is their only way out, I need you here!

985
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,090
但那声音很接近了
But the sound was so close.

986
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,290
-肯定是从房子这一侧传来的  -守在这儿
- It had to be from this side of the house. - Stay here!

987
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,120
不
No!

988
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,770
你答应过保护他安全的  你答应过的
You promised to keep him safe. You promised!

989
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,870
你...
You...

990
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,230
你是人  我知道的
You're human, I know that.

991
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,600
你肯定是
You must be.

992
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,690
我们这样站在黑暗中也没什么用
Little use us standing here in the dark.

993
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,540
毕竟  这是十九世纪
After all, this is the 19th century.

994
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,270
别忘了我
Do not forget me!

995
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:02,620
别忘了我
Do not forget me!

996
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,470
-华生  -她在那儿  她就在那边
- Watson! - She's there! She's down there!

997
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,860
别告诉我你擅离职守了
Don't tell me you abandoned your post!

998
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,710
什么  福尔摩斯  她在那儿  我看见她了
What? Holmes, she's there, I saw her!

999
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,360
没人了  都怪你
Empty, thanks to you!

1000
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,480
煮熟的鸭子飞了
Our bird is flown!

1001
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,040
不  福尔摩斯  不是你想的那样
No! No, Holmes, it wasn't what you think.

1002
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,390
我看见她了  鬼魂
I saw her! The ghost!

1003
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,830
根本没有鬼魂
There are no ghosts!

1004
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,270
发生什么了  尤斯塔斯爵士在哪
What happened? Where is Sir Eustace?

1005
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,520
死了
Dead.

1006
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,030
你不能怪自己
You really mustn't blame yourself, you know.

1007
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,520
是  你说得对
No, you're quite right.

1008
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,430
很高兴你在逐渐开悟
I'm glad you're seeing sense.

1009
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,680
华生也应该受谴责
Watson is equally culpable.

1010
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,050
我们搞砸了整个案子
Between us, we've managed to botch this whole case.

1011
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,810
我做出承诺  要保护那个人
I gave an undertaking to protect that man,

1012
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,580
结果他现在胸口插着匕首  倒在那里
now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast.

1013
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,080
其实  你承诺的是调查他的谋杀案
In fact, you gave an undertaking to investigate his murder.

1014
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,320
满怀没这个必要的自信
In the confident expectation I would not have to!

1015
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,480
你能告诉我们什么吗  医生
Anything you can tell us, Doctor?

1016
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,720
凶手刺杀他的力度可不小
Well, he's been stabbed with considerable force.

1017
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,990
这么说  是男性
It's a man, then?

1018
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,910
可能是
Possibly.

1019
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,760
刀刃非常锋利  也可能是女性
A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman?

1020
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,820
从理论上说  是的
In theory, yes,

1021
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,470
但我们知道是谁  我看见她了
but we know who it was, I saw her.

1022
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,450
-华生  -我看见鬼魂了  亲眼所见
- Watson! - I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!

1023
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,500
你什么也没看见  你看到了别人演的
You saw nothing! You saw what you were supposed to see!

1024
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,340
你自己说过的  我没有想象力
You said yourself, I have no imagination.

1025
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,410
那就动动脑  去掉不可能的情况
Then use your brain, such as it is, to eliminate the impossible,

1026
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:26,770
在这桩案子中就是鬼魂
which in this case is the ghost,

1027
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,010
并且观察余下的  就此而言  就是答案
and observe what remains, which in this case is a solution

1028
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,550
十分明显  就连雷斯垂德也能想明白
so blindingly obvious even Lestrade could work it out!

1029
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,430
谢谢
Thank you!

1030
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,440
别去想什么来自冥界的幽灵了
Forget spectres from the other world!

1031
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,460
只有一个嫌疑人有作案动机和机会
There is only one suspect with motive and opportunity.

1032
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:38,730
他们简直与留了字条无异
They might as well have left a note.

1033
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:39,930
他们确实留下了字条
They did leave a note.

1034
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,990
然后还有另一扇破窗的问题
And then there's the matter of the other broken window.

1035
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,800
-什么另一扇破窗  -说得对  根本没有
- What other broken window? - Precisely! There isn't one.

1036
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,330
唯一一扇破窗就是我和华生进来的那扇
The only broken window is the one that Watson and I entered through,

1037
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,390
但在那之前  我们清楚地听见了声音...
yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of...

1038
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,020
-你刚才说什么  -你说什么
- What did you just say? - Sorry?

1039
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,140
关于字条  你刚才说什么
About a note, what did you just say?

1040
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,800
-我说凶手确实留下了字条  -不  没有
- I said the murderer DID leave a note. - No, they didn't.

1041
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:58,640
匕首上系了张字条  你肯定看见了
There's a message tied to the dagger. You must have seen it!

1042
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,740
-没有什么字条  -有的
- There's no message. - Yes!

1043
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,520
我发现尸体的时候上面没有字条
There was no message when I found the body.

1044
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,820
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

1045
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:24,810
上面写了什么
What is it?

1046
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,620
你想吗
Do you?

1047
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,530
我想什么
Do I what?

1048
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,510
你怎么拿到这个的
H-how did you get that?

1049
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,690
我把它留在犯罪现场了
I left it at the crime scene.

1050
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,350
犯罪现场
"Crime scene"?

1051
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,300
你从哪学来的这些词汇
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

1052
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,650
你想他吗
Do you miss him?

1053
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,490
莫里亚蒂已经死了
Moriarty is dead.

1054
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,880
但是
And yet...?

1055
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,460
我们没找到他的尸体
His body was never recovered.

1056
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,820
一个被推下瀑布的数学教授是该找不到
To be expected when one pushes a maths professor over a waterfall.

1057
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,040
纯粹理性被惊险的情节推翻
Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama.

1058
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,610
一句话概括了你的生活
Your life in a nutshell.

1059
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,620
你从哪学来的这些词汇
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

1060
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,950
你又胖了吗
Have you put on weight?

1061
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,330
你昨天才见过我  你觉得可能吗
You saw me only yesterday. Does that seem possible?

1062
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,380
不可能
No.

1063
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,340
但我的确又胖了
Yet here I am, increased.

1064
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,470
全英格兰
What does that tell

1065
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,140
最好的犯罪调查专家能从中悟到什么
the foremost criminal investigator in England?

1066
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,080
全英格兰
In England?

1067
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,230
你陷得很深  夏洛克
You're in deep, Sherlock,

1068
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,170
比你预想的要深得多
deeper than you ever intended to be.

1069
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,400
-你列清单了吗  -列些什么
- Have you made a list? - Of what?

1070
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,990
所有的  我们需要个清单
Everything. We will need a list.

1071
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,120
好样的
Good boy.

1072
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,770
不  我还没完事
No, I haven't finished yet.

1073
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,180
莫里亚蒂可能不敢苟同
Moriarty may beg to differ.

1074
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:12,880
他想让我分心  转移我的视线
He's trying to distract me. To derail me.

1075
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,300
没错  他是镜片上的裂纹  药膏里的苍蝇
Yes. He's the crack in the lens, the fly in the ointment,

1076
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,430
数据里的病毒
the virus in the data.

1077
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,490
我必须完成
I have to finish this.

1078
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,190
如果莫里亚蒂从莱辛巴赫大锅里爬了出来
If Moriarty has risen from the Reichenbach cauldron,

1079
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,240
他会找到你的
he will seek you out.

1080
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,520
那我等着
I'll be waiting.

1081
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,670
是啊
Yes.

1082
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,180
恐怕你会的
I'm very much afraid you will.

1083
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,820
他已经这样两天了
Two days he's been like that.

1084
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,430
他吃东西了吗
Has he eaten?

1085
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,300
没有  一口都没吃
No, not a morsel.

1086
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,420
媒体都乐疯了
Press are having a ruddy field day.

1087
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,840
外面还有记者蹲守
There's still reporters outside.

1088
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,310
他们一直在那里  我赶不走他们
Oh, they've been there all the time, I can't get rid of them.

1089
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,680
我一直忙着给他泡茶
I've been rushed off my feet making tea.

1090
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,430
你为什么要给他泡茶
Why do you make him tea?

1091
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,120
我不知道  我就这么做了
I dunno, I just sort of do.

1092
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,410
他说"只有一个嫌疑人"  然后就走了
He said, "There's only one suspect," and then he just walks away

1093
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,420
现在又不肯解释
and now he won't explain.

1094
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,180
这很奇怪  他最喜欢解释了
Which is strange, because he likes that bit.

1095
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,220
他说这案子很简单  我都能解开
Said it was so simple I could solve it.

1096
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,640
他肯定是在夸大其词
I'm sure he was exaggerating.

1097
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,360
你觉得他在做什么
What's he doing, do you think?

1098
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,650
-他说他在等待  -等什么
- He says he's waiting. - For what?

1099
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,990
等魔鬼
The devil.

1100
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,230
这可难说
I wouldn't be surprised.

1101
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,090
来这儿的什么人都有
We get all sorts here.

1102
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:22,080
-有变化的话就给我发电报  -好的
- Well, wire me if there's any change. - Yeah.

1103
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,250
我要说的你都想到了吧
Everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.

1104
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:09,150
或许我的回答也已在你脑中浮现过
Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.

1105
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,840
像颗子弹一样
Like a bullet.

1106
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,570
这个习惯很危险
It's a dangerous habit,

1107
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,520
摸着睡衣口袋里上膛的手枪
to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing gown.

1108
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,610
还是你看到我太高兴了
Or are you just pleased to see me?

1109
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,200
请原谅我准备了些预防措施
You'll forgive me for taking precautions.

1110
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,810
你没准备的话我会生气的
I'd be offended if you didn't.

1111
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:38,240
当然  我也礼尚往来了
Obviously, I've returned the courtesy.

1112
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,420
我喜欢你的房间
I like your rooms.

1113
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,010
散发着如此
They smell so...

1114
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,340
阳刚的气息
manly.

1115
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,100
我相信你在此之前就来过了
I'm sure you acquainted yourself with them before now.

1116
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,760
毕竟你总不在这里
Well, you are always away,

1117
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,000
总在为《斯特兰德月刊》探险
on your little adventures for The Strand.

1118
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,800
跟我说说  插画师和你一起出行吗
Tell me, does the illustrator travel with you?

1119
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:08,310
你在推理的时候  要摆造型吗
Do you have to pose... during your deductions?

1120
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,070
你六次趁我不在来拜访我的公寓
I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments

1121
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,070
-我都发现了  -我知道
- during my absence. - I know you are.

1122
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,200
顺便一提  你的床意外地舒服
By the way, you have a surprisingly comfortable bed.

1123
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,520
你知道灰尘主要由人的皮肤组成吗
Did you know that dust is largely composed of human skin?

1124
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,680
知道
Yes.

1125
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,030
不过味道不一样  皮肤还是新鲜的好
Doesn't taste the same, though, you want your skin fresh.

1126
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,760
-脆一点  -你不坐下吗
- Just a little crispy. - Won't you sit down?

1127
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,500
人们本质上就是这样
That's all people really are, you know,

1128
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:37,550
随时会飘散的灰尘
dust waiting to be distributed.

1129
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,970
而且能飘散到各处
And it gets everywhere.

1130
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,140
在呼吸的每口气里  在每束阳光里跳动
In every breath you take, dancing in every sunbeam,

1131
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,460
那些精疲力竭的人啊
all the used-up people.

1132
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,180
引人入胜  你坐下吧
Fascinating, I'm sure. Won't you sit...

1133
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,600
人啊  人啊  人啊
People, people, people!

1134
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,130
什么东西都要落灰
Can't keep anything shiny.

1135
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,800
你介意我开一枪吗
Do you mind if I fire this?

1136
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,920
好清理下灰尘
Just to clean it out.

1137
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,190
没错  我们别玩了
Exactly, let's stop playing.

1138
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,810
我们要杀彼此不需要玩具
We don't need toys to kill each other.

1139
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,460
-那样可不够亲密  -坐下
- Where's the intimacy in that? - Sit down.

1140
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,580
-为什么  你想要什么  -你自己要来的
- Why? What do you want? - You chose to come here.

1141
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,320
假话  你知道那是假话
Not true, you know that's not true.

1142
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:24,610
你想要什么  夏洛克
What do you want, Sherlock?

1143
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,130
真相
The truth.

1144
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,460
那个啊  真相很无聊
That. Truth's boring!

1145
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:35,630
你没料想到
You didn't expect me to

1146
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,820
我会出现在犯罪现场  是吗
turn up at the scene of the crime, did you?

1147
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,510
可怜的尤斯塔斯爵士  他罪有应得
Poor old Sir Eustace. He got what was coming to him.

1148
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,800
但他不可能是你杀的
But you couldn't have killed him.

1149
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,570
那又怎样  这重要吗  够了  别这样
Oh, so what? Does it matter? Stop it. Stop this.

1150
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,100
你才不关心尤斯塔斯爵士  还有什么新娘
You don't care about Sir Eustace, or the Bride, or any of it.

1151
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,820
整个事件中只有一样
There's only one thing in this whole business

1152
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,150
引起了你的注意
that you find interesting.

1153
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,550
我知道你在干什么
I know what you're doing.

1154
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,470
新娘把枪口伸进嘴里
The Bride put a gun in her mouth

1155
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:59,620
把自己的后脑勺打开了花
and shot the back of her head off

1156
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,100
然后她复活了
and then she came back.

1157
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,810
不可能  但她做到了
Impossible. But she did it.

1158
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,380
你想知道是怎么做到的
And you need to know how.

1159
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:09,990
到底怎么回事
How?

1160
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,850
对不对
Don't you?

1161
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,410
因为不知道  你的世界都要崩溃了
It's tearing your world apart, not knowing.

1162
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,130
你想阻止我
You're trying to stop me...

1163
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,320
想让我分心  转移我的视线
To distract me, derail me.

1164
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,570
因为你是不是想起了另一个案子
Because doesn't this remind you of another case?

1165
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,520
以前是不是发生过类似的事
Hasn't this all happened before?

1166
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,800
太阳底下无新事  到底是什么
There's nothing new under the sun. What was it?

1167
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,240
是什么呢   是哪个案子
What was it? What was that case?

1168
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,120
你记得吗
Do you remember?

1169
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,210
就在嘴边了  就在嘴边了
It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the tip of my tongue.

1170
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,720
就在我的嘴边
It's on the tip of my tongue.

1171
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,470
就在...
It's on the tip...

1172
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,640
嘴边
..Of my tongue.

1173
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,920
为了赫德森太太的壁纸着想  我必须提醒你
For the sake of Mrs Hudson's wallpaper, I must remind you

1174
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,840
你的手指稍微动一下  你就会死
that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.

1175
00:58:59,090 --> 00:58:59,960
什么
I'm sorry?

1176
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:06,240
死亡  是新的潮流
Dead...is the new sexy.

1177
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,120
说真的  这么一来脑子挺清爽的
Well, I'll tell you what, that rather blows the cobwebs away.

1178
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,180
你怎么还活着
How can you be alive?

1179
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,110
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

1180
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,830
老实说  是不是很显眼
You can be honest, is it noticeable?

1181
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,350
你把脑袋打爆了  怎么可能活下来
You blew your own brains out, how could you survive?

1182
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,570
也许我该梳个大背头
Or maybe I could backcomb.

1183
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,380
我亲眼看到你死了
I saw you die.

1184
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,100
为什么没死呢
Why aren't you dead?

1185
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:43,110
因为丧命不是因为坠落  夏洛克
Because it's not the fall that kills you, Sherlock.

1186
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,270
你应该比别人更清楚  坠落不死人
Of all people, you should know that, it's not the fall,

1187
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,340
从来如此
it's never the fall.

1188
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,000
人是落地摔死的
It's the landing!

1189
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,890
我们落地了  先生
We've landed, sir.

1190
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,330
我们落地了
We've landed.

1191
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,230
不不  现在不行  还不行
No, no, not now, not now!

1192
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,940
现在不行  不行
Not now, not now.

1193
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,610
您的旅程还舒适吧  先生
I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir?

1194
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,410
嗯  这次流放的时间
Well, a somewhat shorter exile

1195
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,710
没有我们想的长  弟弟
than we'd imagined, brother mine,

1196
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,960
但考虑到你强迫症的程度  可能足够了
but probably adequate, given your levels of OCD.

1197
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,240
-我得回去  -什么
- I have to go back! - What?

1198
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,070
我就快想出来了  就差一点点
I was...I was nearly there, I nearly had it!

1199
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,370
你到底在说什么
What on earth are you talking about?

1200
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,820
回哪里去  你都没飞多远
Go back where? You didn't get very far.

1201
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,120
瑞克莱蒂和他的恐怖新娘  你们不明白吗
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don't you understand?!

1202
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,710
我们当然不明白  你说什么胡话呢  夏洛克
No, of course we don't, you're not making any sense, Sherlock.

1203
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,540
是一个案子  一百年前很有名的案子
It was a case, a famous one from 100 years ago.

1204
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,030
存在我硬盘里
Lodged in my hard drive,

1205
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,410
本来她应该死了  但又复活了
she seemed to be dead, but then she came back.

1206
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,400
什么  跟莫里亚蒂一样
What, like Moriarty?

1207
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,430
打爆了自己的脑袋  完全和莫里亚蒂一样
Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.

1208
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,510
但你刚刚才知道
But you've only just been told.

1209
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,410
我们也是才发现
We've only just found out,

1210
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:51,760
他出现在全国每一块电视屏幕上
he's on every TV screen in the country.

1211
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,820
是啊  怎么  麦考夫是五分钟前打的电话
Yes? So? It's been five minutes since Mycroft called.

1212
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:57,070
你们有什么进展  你们做了什么
What progress have you made? What have you been doing?

1213
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,400
更重要的是  你做了什么
More to the point, what have YOU been doing?

1214
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,060
-我当然在思维殿堂了  -那当然
- I've been in my Mind Palace, of course. - Of course.

1215
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,930
正在做思维实验  假设我在1895年
Running an experiment. How would I have solved the crime,

1216
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:06,310
-应该如何破案  -夏洛克啊
- if I'd been there in 1895? - Oh, Sherlock.

1217
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,110
所有的细节都很清楚
I had all the details perfect.

1218
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,830
我完全沉浸在里面  全身心的
I was there, all of it, everything. I was immersed.

1219
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:11,660
当然了
Of course you were.

1220
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,440
你在看约翰的博客  你们相遇的故事
You've been reading John's blog. The story of how you met.

1221
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,770
有时候通过他的眼睛看我自己有好处
It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes.

1222
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,030
那样我聪明多了
I'm so much cleverer.

1223
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,800
你真以为有人会相信你的说法
Do you really think anyone is believing you?

1224
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,150
不  他可以做到  我见过
No, he can do this, I've seen it.

1225
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,520
思维殿堂  大脑中有整个世界
The Mind Palace, it's like a whole world in his head.

1226
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,120
是的  我需要再回去
Yes, and I need to get back there.

1227
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,850
思维殿堂是一种记忆手段  我知道它的功用
The Mind Palace is a memory technique, I know what it can do

1228
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,450
也知道它的局限
and I know what it most certainly cannot.

1229
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,010
也许有那么一两件事  我知道而你不知道
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don't.

1230
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,560
当然有了
Oh, there are.

1231
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:41,900
你列了清单吗
Did you make a list?

1232
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,560
你又胖了
You've put on weight.

1233
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,030
马甲显然比外套新
That waistcoat is clearly newer than the jacket.

1234
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,560
-别说了  你列清单了吗  -什么清单
- Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list?! - Of what?

1235
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,600
所有的  夏洛克  你服的所有药物
Everything, Sherlock. Everything you've taken.

1236
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,500
不  不是那样  他就是出神了
No, it's not that, he goes into a sort of trance.

1237
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,440
我见过他那样做
I've seen him do it.

1238
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,940
从那天起  弟弟和我达成了协议
We have an agreement, my brother and I, ever since that day.

1239
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,230
不管在哪里找到他
Wherever I find him,

1240
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,780
背街小巷也好  小客栈也罢
whatever back alley or doss-house...

1241
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,730
一定要有张清单
..There will always be a list.

1242
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:22,500
他不可能在五分钟内服这么多
He couldn't have taken all that in the last five minutes.

1243
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,480
他上飞机前就嗨了
He was high before he got on the plane.

1244
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,890
看起来不像
He didn't seem high.

1245
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,430
瘾君子最能骗人
Nobody deceives like an addict.

1246
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,190
我不是瘾君子  我只是服用药物
I'm not an addict, I'm a user.

1247
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,940
减缓我无聊的情绪
I alleviate boredom and

1248
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,420
或者偶尔提高我的思考效率
occasionally heighten my thought processes.

1249
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,160
老天  这可能要了你的命
For God's sake! This could kill you!

1250
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,100
-你可能会死  -控制剂量就不会致命
- You could die! - Controlled usage is not usually fatal

1251
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,540
节制的生活也不能永生
and abstinence is not immortality.

1252
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,470
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1253
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:45,280
艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂  我在搜她
Emelia Ricoletti, I'm looking her up.

1254
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,400
好吧  也许是应该看看
Oh, I suppose we should.

1255
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,410
我有权查询军情五处的最高机密资料库
I have access to the top level of the MI5 archive.

1256
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,980
对  我正在那儿搜索
Yep, that's where I'm looking.

1257
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,920
你认为军情五处的防火墙怎么样
What do you think of MI5 security?

1258
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,920
弄一个也挺好的
I think it would be a good idea.

1259
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,980
艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂  "悬案"
Emelia Ricoletti, "Unsolved",

1260
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,200
跟他说的一样
like he says.

1261
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,860
你们能不能闭嘴五分钟
Could you all just shut up for five minutes!

1262
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,050
我必须回去
I have to go back.

1263
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,960
我就快破案了
I was nearly there before

1264
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,800
结果让你们跑进来吵没了
you stepped on and started yapping away!

1265
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,280
吵  抱歉  我们是打扰你治疗了吗
"Yapping?" Sorry, did we interrupt your session?

1266
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,650
夏洛克  听我说
Sherlock, listen to me.

1267
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,070
不想听  你越说越来劲
No, it only encourages you.

1268
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:16,110
-我没生你的气  -我真松了口气啊
- I'm not angry with you. - Oh, that's a relief!

1269
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,530
我本来还一直担心呢  不  等等
I was really worried... No, hold on,

1270
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,620
我真没担心
I really wasn't.

1271
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,260
我以前救过你
I was there for you before.

1272
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,490
下一次我还会救你
I'll be there for you again.

1273
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,530
不论多少次我都会救你
I'll always be there for you.

1274
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:31,940
这是我的错
This was my fault.

1275
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,470
这与你无关
It was nothing to do with you.

1276
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,440
入狱一周
A week in a prison cell,

1277
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,340
-我该意识到的  -意识到什么
- I should have realised. - Realised what?

1278
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,450
对你来说
That, in your case,

1279
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,730
单独监禁其实是和死敌关在一起
solitary confinement is locking you up with your worst enemy.

1280
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,130
我的神啊
Oh, for God's sake!

1281
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,610
吗啡还是可卡因
Morphine or cocaine?

1282
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,290
你说什么
What did you say?

1283
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,900
我什么也没说
I didn't say anything.

1284
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:52,320
不  你说了  你说
No, you did, you said...

1285
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,590
今天是什么  吗啡还是可卡因
Which is it today? Morphine or cocaine.

1286
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,430
福尔摩斯
'Holmes?'

1287
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,910
吗啡还是可卡因  今天是什么
Morphine or cocaine - which is it today?

1288
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,190
回答我  该死的
Answer me, damn it!

1289
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,230
莫里亚蒂来过
Moriarty was here.

1290
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,280
莫里亚蒂死了
Moriarty's dead.

1291
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,430
我刚刚在飞机上
I was on a jet.

1292
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,070
什么上
A what?

1293
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,920
你也在  还有麦考夫
You were there, and Mycroft.

1294
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,770
你就没出过门  福尔摩斯
You haven't left these rooms, Holmes.

1295
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:23,670
连动都没动一下
You...haven't...moved.

1296
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,480
告诉我  是吗啡还是可卡因
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?

1297
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,120
可卡因  7%的
Cocaine. A 7% solution.

1298
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:33,500
-想来点吗  -不想
- Would you care to try it? - No.

1299
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,870
但我十分想把这儿所有的
But I would quite like to find every ounce of the stuff

1300
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,660
这破玩意儿都找到然后倒窗外
in your possession and pour it out of the window.

1301
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,720
那我会想阻止你
I should be inclined to stop you.

1302
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,610
那我将用强有力的方式提醒你
Then you would be reminded, quite forcibly,

1303
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,780
我们两个中谁是军人  谁是瘾君子
which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.

1304
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,110
你不是军人  你是个医生
You're not a soldier, you are a doctor.

1305
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,550
我是个军医  也就是说我可以
I'm an army doctor, which means I could break

1306
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,820
在掰断你每一根骨头时顺便叫出它的学名
every bone in your body while naming them.

1307
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:56,280
亲爱的华生  你的感情干扰了你的判断
My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgment.

1308
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:57,360
办案不吸毒
Never on a case.

1309
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,890
你保证过的  办案不吸毒
You promised me, never on a case.

1310
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,520
不  那是出自
No, I just said that

1311
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,020
-你的一篇故事  -听着
- in one of your stories. - Listen,

1312
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,970
我很乐意为你扮演捧哏
I'm happy to play the fool for you.

1313
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,820
我可以笨蛋一样跟着你到处跑
I will run along behind you like some halfwit,

1314
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,620
衬托出你的聪明  如果你需要如此
making you look clever, if that's what you need.

1315
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,400
但看在上帝分上
But dear God above,

1316
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,640
你得给自己定个更高的标准
you will hold yourself to a higher standard!

1317
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,780
-为什么  -因为人们需要你
- Why? - Because people need you to.

1318
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,880
什么人  为什么  就因为你的蠢故事
What people, why? Because of your idiot stories?

1319
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,330
没错  就因为我的蠢故事
Yes, because of my "Idiot stories".

1320
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:23,650
福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

1321
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:27,150
福尔摩斯先生  电报  福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes, telegram, Mr Holmes.

1322
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,650
怎么了  出什么事了
What is it? What's wrong?

1323
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:40,040
-是玛丽  -玛丽  她怎么了
- It's Mary. - Mary? What about her?

1324
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,190
-她很有可能陷入了危险  -危险
- It's entirely possible she's in danger. - Danger?

1325
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,500
一刻也不能耽误了
There's not a moment to lose.

1326
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,060
这是你吸毒的幻觉吗
Is this the cocaine talking?

1327
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,640
玛丽能有什么危险
What danger could Mary be in?

1328
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,620
-她肯定只是去拜访朋友了  -快走
- I'm sure she's just visiting with friends. - Come on!

1329
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,600
到底怎么了
What is happening?

1330
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,460
你这状况真的可以吗
Are you even in a fit state?

1331
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,450
为玛丽当然可以  这毋庸置疑  华生
For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson.

1332
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:04,480
毋庸置疑
Never that.

1333
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,500
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

1334
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:07,860
我没事  我没事
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1335
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,980
别戴那顶
Not that one!

1336
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,070
戴这顶
This one.

1337
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,610
-为什么  -你是夏洛克·福尔摩斯
- Why? - You're Sherlock Holmes.

1338
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,770
戴你该戴的帽子吧
Wear the damn hat.

1339
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,980
出租马车  马车
Cab! Cab!

1340
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,650
说吧  她在哪
So tell me, where is she?

1341
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,430
告诉我  到底是怎么回事
You must tell me, what's going on?!

1342
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,490
我的好华生啊
Oh, good old Watson!

1343
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,880
你不问问题我们这些闲暇时间该怎么过啊
How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?!

1344
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,460
夏洛克  快告诉我  我妻子在哪
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody wife is,

1345
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,470
你这个自大的混蛋
you pompous prick,

1346
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,000
否则我真跟你动手
or I'll punch your lights out!

1347
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,990
福尔摩斯  她在哪
Holmes, where is she?

1348
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,350
一个废弃教堂
A de-sanctified church.

1349
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:49,810
她觉得她找到了答案
She thinks she's found the solution and,

1350
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:50,940
也正因此
for no better reason than that,

1351
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,340
她让自己陷入了巨大的危险
she's put herself in the path of considerable danger.

1352
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,450
这妻子真是选的好啊
What an excellent choice of wife.

1353
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,130
搞什么
What the devil?!

1354
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:10,290
我找到他们了
I've found them.

1355
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:19,820
这是什么啊  玛丽
What is all this, Mary?

1356
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,940
是一切的核心  约翰
This is the heart of it all, John.

1357
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,580
阴谋的核心
The heart of the conspiracy.

1358
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,880
神啊  这是什么地方啊
Great God, what is this place?

1359
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,200
而且你又来这儿干什么
And what the devil are you doing here?!

1360
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,030
我一直在调查
I've been making enquiries.

1361
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,270
应福尔摩斯先生之请
Mr Holmes asked me.

1362
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,430
福尔摩斯  你怎么能这么做
Holmes, how could you?

1363
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,460
不  不是他  聪明的那位
No, not him, the clever one.

1364
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:57,040
我认为很明显
It seemed obvious to me

1365
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,450
这件事一个人无法完成
that this business could not be managed alone.

1366
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,220
我认为瑞克莱蒂太太有帮手
My theory is that Mrs Ricoletti had help.

1367
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,620
她的朋友
Help from her friends.

1368
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,360
-漂亮  玛丽  "聪明的那位"  -我
- Bravo, Mary. "The clever one?" - I...

1369
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,720
我以为我要失去你了
I thought I was losing you.

1370
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,620
我以为我们
I thought perhaps we were...

1371
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,270
-在冷战  -是你先搬出去的
- neglecting each other. - Well, you're the one who moved out.

1372
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,340
我是在跟玛丽说话
I was talking to Mary.

1373
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,850
你怎么为麦考夫办事了
You're working for Mycroft?

1374
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,040
他想监督他的疯弟弟
He likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling.

1375
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,470
而且手头正好有间谍  你从来没发现
And he had a spy to hand. Has it never occurred to you

1376
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:25,480
你妻子的能力远超普通护士吗
your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?

1377
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,470
他当然没发现
Of course it hasn't,

1378
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:28,990
因为他知道护士该有的能力
because he knows what a nurse is capable of.

1379
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,170
你又是什么时候发现的
When did it occur to you?

1380
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,430
刚发现  不好意思
Only now, I'm afraid.

1381
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,880
肯定很痛苦吧
Must be difficult,

1382
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,760
当天才的笨弟弟
being the slow little brother.

1383
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,150
也该跟上节奏了  聊够了  办正事
Time I sped up. Enough chatter, let's concentrate.

1384
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,960
好吧  这是干什么
Yes, all right. What's all this about?

1385
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,820
他们想做什么
What do they want to accomplish?

1386
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,370
进去弄个明白吧
Why don't we go and find out.

1387
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,920
抱歉  见到锣不敲就难受
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.

1388
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,270
-少了戏剧性也难受  -谁能想到呢
- Or a touch of the dramatic. - Never have guessed!

1389
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,910
你们好像跟我一样  喜欢戏剧性
Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard.

1390
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,610
真棒
Excellent.

1391
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,820
一流的剧场
Superlative theatre.

1392
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,830
场面令人赞叹
I applaud the spectacle.

1393
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,360
艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂饮弹自尽
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself,

1394
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,880
然后起死回生  杀死了她丈夫
then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband.

1395
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,190
那么...
So...

1396
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,210
是怎么回事呢
how was it done?

1397
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,070
按时间顺序回顾一下吧
Let's take the events in order.

1398
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,950
瑞克莱蒂太太用最快的速度
Mrs. Ricoletti gets everyone's attention

1399
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:38,980
-吸引了所有人的注意力  -你
- in very efficient fashion. - You!

1400
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,870
你
You?!

1401
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,490
还是我
Or me?

1402
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,360
她把一把枪塞进嘴里
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth,

1403
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,400
开火的却是枪口朝下的另一把枪
while actually firing the other into the ground.

1404
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,420
她的同谋向窗帘上喷血
An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood

1405
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,710
这样楼下惊慌失措的民众
and thus her apparent suicide

1406
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:55,030
就都看到了她自杀的景象
is witnessed by the frightened crowd below.

1407
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:57,710
另找一具
A substitute corpse,

1408
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,640
跟瑞克莱蒂太太非常相似的尸体
bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs. Ricoletti

1409
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,070
来代替她  稍后被送进停尸房
takes her place and is later transported to the morgue,

1410
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:05,450
这种自杀的小案子苏格兰场也没什么兴趣
a grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard.

1411
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:09,490
同时真的瑞克莱蒂太太悄悄溜走
Meanwhile, the real Mrs. Ricoletti slips away.

1412
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,730
真正聪明的是这步
Now comes the really clever part.

1413
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:18,660
瑞克莱蒂太太说服一位认识她的马车夫
Mrs. Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver, someone who knew her,

1414
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:21,680
拉她去丈夫最喜欢的鸦片馆外等他
to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.

1415
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,990
完美的舞台  完美的一出戏
The perfect stage for a perfect drama.

1416
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,980
你是谁  你要干什么
Who are you? What do you want?

1417
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,280
艾米丽娅
Emelia?

1418
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:31,850
救命
Help!

1419
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:33,960
身份得到完全确认
A perfect positive identification.

1420
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,350
已故的瑞克莱蒂太太起死回生
The late Mrs. Ricoletti has returned from the grave

1421
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,420
加上化妆师的手笔
and a little skilled make-up

1422
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,450
写就了一出怨灵复仇的戏码
and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost.

1423
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:56,210
还剩最后一件事
There was only one thing left to do.

1424
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,310
快点  别落泪
Swiftly now. No tears.

1425
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,660
最后一步就是把真的瑞克莱蒂太太
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs. Ricoletti

1426
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,020
跟假尸体掉包
for the corpse in the morgue.

1427
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,700
这次再有人来验尸
This time, should anyone attempt to identify her,

1428
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,880
就能确认的确是她
it would be positively, absolutely her.

1429
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,350
但她为什么要这样
But why would she do that?

1430
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,230
用死来证明什么
Die to prove a point?

1431
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,110
大业都需要殉道者
Every great cause has martyrs.

1432
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:22,740
战争也都需要献身  没错  这就是战争
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake, this is war.

1433
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,740
半边天向另一半宣战
One half of the human race at war with the other.

1434
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:30,180
这支常伴身边的无形军队
The invisible army hovering at our elbow,

1435
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,150
打理家事
tending to our homes,

1436
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,150
养育孩子
raising our children.

1437
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:37,830
没人注意  不受重视
Ignored, patronised,

1438
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,520
被人忽略
disregarded.

1439
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,570
投一票的权利都没有
Not allowed so much as a vote.

1440
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:53,230
但依然是支军队
But an army nonetheless,

1441
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,100
准备为崇高的事业而战
ready to rise up in the best of causes.

1442
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:01,150
反抗由来已久的不平等
To put right an injustice as old as humanity itself.

1443
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:05,610
所以  华生  麦考夫说对了
So you see, Watson, Mycroft was right.

1444
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,730
这场战争我们必须输
This is a war we must lose.

1445
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:09,490
她要死了
She was dying.

1446
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,560
-谁  -艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂
- Who was? - Emelia Ricoletti.

1447
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,350
能看出明显的肺痨症状
There were clear signs of consumption -

1448
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:17,030
她应该是活不长了
I doubt she was long for this world.

1449
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,780
所以她想死得有意义点
So she decided to make her death count.

1450
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,460
她已经跟美国的秘密社团很熟悉了
She was already familiar with the secret societies of America.

1451
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:26,410
还使用了她们那套恐怖
And was able to draw on their methods of fear

1452
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,640
威胁的手法  在非常公开的场合下
and intimidation to publicly, very publicly,

1453
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,000
跟尤斯塔斯·卡迈克爵士对峙他过去的罪行
confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.

1454
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,920
他在美国就结识了她
He knew her out in the States.

1455
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:37,290
给她许诺了一切
Promised her everything.

1456
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,190
婚姻  地位
Marriage, position.

1457
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,170
然后玩弄过她...
And then he had his way with her...

1458
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:46,830
就抛弃了她
..and threw her over.

1459
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:49,690
丢下身无分文的她
Left her abandoned and penniless.

1460
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,160
霍普
Hooper!

1461
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:57,790
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

1462
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,960
正式声明  福尔摩斯  她可没瞒过我
For the record, Holmes, she didn't have me fooled.

1463
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,610
您为什么从不提我  先生
Why do you never mention me, sir?

1464
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,270
艾米丽娅以为跟瑞克莱蒂会幸福
Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti,

1465
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,400
但他也是个畜生
but he was a brute too.

1466
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,730
艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂是我们的朋友
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.

1467
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,890
你不知道那个混账是怎么对她的
You have no idea how that bastard treated her.

1468
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,680
可是新娘  福尔摩斯  我们看到她了
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.

1469
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:36,570
是啊  华生  看到了
Yes, Watson, we did.

1470
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:38,930
打碎镜子的声音
The sound of breaking glass?

1471
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:40,360
碎的不是窗户
Not a window,

1472
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,280
不过是个剧院的老把戏
just an old theatrical trick.

1473
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,270
这不可能  福尔摩斯  不可能
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

1474
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,540
是不可能
No, it can't.

1475
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:49,570
叫做佩珀尔幻象
'It's called Pepper's Ghost.

1476
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,740
一个活人
'A simple reflection in glass

1477
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,140
在玻璃镜的倒影
of a living, breathing person.

1478
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:59,440
只是她们搬玻璃镜时  把它给弄碎了
'Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.'

1479
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:02,750
看看四周
Look around you.

1480
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,250
这屋里都是新娘
This room is full of brides.

1481
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:13,230
她站了起来
Once she had risen,

1482
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,350
可能成为任何人
anyone could be her.

1483
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,270
复仇的鬼魂
The avenging ghost.

1484
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,260
一个传说  令心怀不轨的男人
A legend to strike terror into the heart of any man

1485
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,980
恐惧战栗
with malicious intent.

1486
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,520
纠缠不休的鬼魂
A spectre to stalk those

1487
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,400
与犯下罪孽却未遭惩戒的人清算过去
unpunished brutes whose reckoning is long overdue.

1488
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:32,320
一支愤怒军团觉醒了
A league of furies awakened.

1489
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,150
那位我...
The women I...

1490
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,710
我们欺骗过  背叛过的女人
WE have lied to, betrayed.

1491
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,630
我们忽略过  蔑视过的女人
The women we have ignored and disparaged.

1492
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,730
一旦产生了这种想法
Once the idea exists,

1493
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,790
就难以消除了
it cannot be killed.

1494
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:57,180
想出这个主意的人意志坚定
This is the work of a single-minded person.

1495
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,610
并且非常了解尤斯塔斯爵士的精神虐待
Someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.

1496
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,640
阴暗的秘密
The dark secret,

1497
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:06,620
只告诉了她最好的朋友
kept from all but her closest friends,

1498
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,960
包括艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂
including Emelia Ricoletti...

1499
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:13,240
那个多年之前遭她丈夫亏待的女人
..the woman her husband wronged all those years before.

1500
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,490
如果排除鬼魂
If one disregards the ghost,

1501
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:19,110
就只剩一个嫌疑人
there is only one suspect.

1502
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,640
是不是  卡迈克夫人
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?

1503
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:28,150
但是有一个小地方我不太明白
One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however.

1504
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:33,000
为什么要找我阻止一桩
Why engage me to prevent a murder

1505
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,140
你打算实施的谋杀
you intended to commit?

1506
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,200
不太明白
"Doesn't quite make sense,

1507
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,150
不太明白
doesn't quite make sense."

1508
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,900
你当然明白不了  这不是真的
Of course it doesn't make sense, it's not real.

1509
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,570
夏洛克啊
Oh, Sherlock.

1510
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,310
躲躲猫
Peek-a-boo.

1511
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,200
不
No.

1512
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:54,070
不  不是你
No, not you.

1513
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:56,740
不可能是你
It can't be you.

1514
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,970
得了  好好想想
I mean, come on, be serious.

1515
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,270
扮装  锣
The costumes, the gong?

1516
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,420
作为犯罪大师
Speaking as a criminal mastermind,

1517
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,320
我得说我们可不会用锣  或是扮装
we don't really have gongs or special outfits.

1518
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:09,790
这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

1519
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,380
这对你来说够蠢了吗
Is this silly enough for you yet?

1520
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,450
够哥特了吗  够疯狂了吗  即使对你而言
Gothic enough? Mad enough, even for you?

1521
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,550
你不明白  夏洛克
It doesn't make sense, Sherlock,

1522
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,580
因为这不是真的
because it's not real.

1523
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,260
-都不是真的  -他在说什么
- None of it. - What's he talking about?

1524
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,730
这都是你自己在瞎想
This is all in your mind.

1525
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,370
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1526
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,320
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

1527
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,350
你在做梦
You're dreaming.

1528
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,620
他是在做梦吗
Is he dreaming?

1529
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,120
他醒了
And there he is.

1530
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,710
还以为你已经去了
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.

1531
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:43,800
我问一下  这就是你说的"控制剂量"吗
May I just check, is this what you mean by "controlled usage"?

1532
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,830
艾米丽娅·瑞克莱蒂太太  告诉我她埋在哪
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti, I need to know where she was buried.

1533
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:49,990
-你是说120年前吗  -是的
- What, 120 years ago? - Yes.

1534
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:53,360
那要找上几周才能找到  前提是有记录
That would take weeks to find, if those records even exists.

1535
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,820
-即使借用我的资源  -查到了
- Even with my resources. - Got it.

1536
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,770
我不明白  和这有什么关系
I don't get it, how is this relevant?

1537
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,770
我得先知道我是对的  然后我才能肯定
I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.

1538
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:03,510
-你是说莫里亚蒂怎么做到的  -没错
- You mean how Moriarty did it? - Yes.

1539
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:05,340
但那些并没有发生  都是你自己想的
But none of that really happened, it was in your head.

1540
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,920
我的调查是想象的
My investigation was the fantasy,

1541
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,600
但犯罪方式就如我刚刚所说的那样
the crime happened exactly as I explained.

1542
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,600
她的墓碑是她的一群朋友给她立的
The stone was erected by a group of her friends.

1543
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,460
-我不知道你想在这儿找到什么  -我得试试
- I don't know what you think you'll find here. - I need to try!

1544
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,280
瑞克莱蒂太太埋在这里
Mrs Ricoletti was buried here,

1545
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,310
但是另外一具尸体呢
but what happened to the other one?

1546
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:27,290
在所谓的自杀之后用来替换她的那具尸体
The corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide?

1547
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,620
-他们肯定给移走了  -移去哪了
- They'd move it, of course they would. - But where?

1548
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,660
不在这里
Well, not here.

1549
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:33,100
但是  他们肯定会这么做
But that... that's exactly what they must have done.

1550
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,900
同谋有内应
The conspirators had someone on the inside.

1551
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,520
他们找到一具尸体
They found a body,

1552
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:37,490
就像茉莉·霍普给我找了具尸体
just like Molly Hooper found a body for me, when...

1553
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,680
这不需要再说了  对吧
Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we?

1554
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,210
你不会真的想这么做吧
You're not seriously going to do this?

1555
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:44,750
我们正是为此而来  我必须知道
It's why we came here. I need to know.

1556
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,180
真是瘾君子的口气
Spoken like an addict.

1557
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:47,350
这对我来说很重要
This is important to me!

1558
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:49,030
不  你这是在嗑药
No, this is you needing a fix.

1559
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,350
-约翰  -莫里亚蒂回来了
- John... - Moriarty's back.

1560
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:53,030
我们有案子要解决  我们有现实问题
We have a case, we have a real-life problem right now.

1561
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,570
我下一个就解决它  就快了
Getting to that, it's next on the list.

1562
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,290
我要先把这事做了
Just let me do this.

1563
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,220
不  我们总是让你为所欲为
No, everyone always lets you do whatever you want.

1564
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:59,230
-所以你才落得这个样子  -约翰  求你了
- That's how you got in this state! - John, please...

1565
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,800
我这次不会陪你玩了  夏洛克  别想了
I'm not playing this time, Sherlock. Not any more!

1566
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,670
你什么时候准备好工作了  给我打电话
When you're ready to go to work, give me a call.

1567
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,330
-我要带玛丽回家了  -你要什么
- I'm taking Mary home. - You're what?

1568
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:07,870
-玛丽要带我回家了  -这还差不多
- Mary's taking me home. - Better.

1569
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:11,810
-他是对的  你知道  -对又怎么样
- He's right, you know. - So what if he's right?!

1570
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,560
他总是对的  很无聊
He's always right, it's boring!

1571
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,580
你能帮我吗
Will you help me?

1572
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:23,420
{\an3}法国谚语
原意是如果一个男人行为怪异
就"去找到在与他偷情的女人吧"

1573
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:23,420
找到这个女人吧
Cherchez la femme.

1574
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,620
上帝啊
Oh, dear.

1575
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,880
不在里面
The cupboard is bare.

1576
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:14,340
肯定埋在下面了
They must have buried it underneath.

1577
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,130
肯定埋在棺材下面了
They must have buried it underneath the coffin.

1578
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:32,910
不走运  夏洛克
Bad luck, Sherlock.

1579
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,100
也许他们用其他方式处理了尸体
Maybe they got rid of the body in another way.

1580
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,610
-不  -很有可能
- No... - More than likely.

1581
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,540
毕竟这是很久之前的事了
At any rate, it was a very long time ago.

1582
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,740
而我们可还有更重要的事需要办  弟弟
We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand, little brother.

1583
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,260
莫里亚蒂  死而复生
Moriarty? Back from the dead?

1584
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,620
别忘了我
'Do not forget me.

1585
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,670
别忘了我
'Do not forget me!'

1586
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,380
这是
This?

1587
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:11,440
我明白了
Oh, I see.

1588
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:14,810
还是没醒  是吗
Still not awake, am I?

1589
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:43,470
太深了  夏洛克  太深了
Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.

1590
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,950
恭喜  你将是史上第一个被活埋在
Congratulations, you will be the first man in history

1591
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:49,640
自己的思维殿堂里的人
to be buried in his own Mind Palace.

1592
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,090
场景布置的有点夸张了  你不觉得吗
The setting is a shade melodramatic, don't you think?

1593
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:55,270
对你我而言
For you and me?

1594
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,760
一点都不夸张
Not at all.

1595
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,030
你到底是什么
What are you?

1596
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,190
你知道我是什么
You know what I am.

1597
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:06,120
我是莫里亚蒂
I'm Moriarty.

1598
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,450
犯罪界的拿破仑
The Napoleon of Crime.

1599
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:10,840
-莫里亚蒂已经死了  -在你脑中可没有
- Moriarty's dead! - Not in your mind.

1600
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,560
在你脑中我永远都不会死
I'll never be dead there.

1601
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,800
你曾说你的大脑是块硬盘
You once called your brain a hard drive.

1602
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,070
跟病毒打个招呼吧
Well, say hello to the virus.

1603
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,740
这就是我们的结局  你和我
This is how we end, you and I.

1604
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,780
总是在这里
Always here,

1605
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:24,950
总是你和我一起
always together.

1606
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:30,330
你的脑子很不错  莫里亚蒂
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.

1607
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:31,960
我很敬佩
I admire it.

1608
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:35,770
我认为它甚至可能与我相当
I concede it may even be the equal of my own.

1609
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,240
我很感动
I'm touched.

1610
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:40,890
我很荣幸
I'm honoured.

1611
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,820
但说到在悬崖边缘
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat

1612
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:45,750
徒手搏斗
on the edge of a precipice...

1613
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,870
你等着入水吧
You're going in the water,

1614
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,370
小个子
short-arse.

1615
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:06,330
你觉得自己高大威猛吗  夏洛克
Oh, you think you're so big and strong, Sherlock!

1616
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,490
在我面前可不是
Not with me.

1617
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:22,560
我是你的弱点
I am your weakness!

1618
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:25,990
我能打倒你
I keep you down!

1619
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:31,270
每次你失足  每次你失败
Every time you stumble, every time you fail,

1620
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,070
每当你势弱
when you're weak,

1621
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,820
我都
I...am...

1622
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:36,460
在那儿
there!

1623
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:39,980
不
No,

1624
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,930
别抵抗
don't try to fight it.

1625
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:44,030
躺好  认输吧
Lie back and lose!

1626
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,220
我们一起跳下去吧
Shall we go over together?

1627
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,710
必须是我们一起  是吧
It has to be together, doesn't it?

1628
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:56,460
到最后  永远是你
At the end it's always just you

1629
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,290
和我
and me!

1630
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,580
教授  麻烦你离我朋友远点
Professor, if you wouldn't mind stepping away from my friend,

1631
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:10,590
我相信  他有点反感你的纠缠
I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.

1632
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,560
这不公平  你们二对一
That's not fair, there's two of you!

1633
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:18,090
我们总是两个人  你不看《斯特兰德月刊》吗
There's always two of us. Don't you read The Strand?

1634
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:21,660
跪下  教授
On your knees, Professor.

1635
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:28,770
手背到头后
Hands behind your head.

1636
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,530
谢谢你  约翰
Thank you, John.

1637
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,200
你什么时候开始叫我约翰了
Since when do you call me John?

1638
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,790
你肯定想不到
You'd be surprised.

1639
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,000
未必
No, I wouldn't.

1640
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:42,320
你该醒来了  夏洛克
Time you woke up, Sherlock.

1641
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,480
我是个讲故事的  我分得出自己是在故事里
I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.

1642
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,990
当然
Of course.

1643
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,300
当然了  约翰
Of course you do, John.

1644
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,260
他什么样
So what's he like?

1645
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,360
另一个世界的我
The other me in the other place?

1646
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,910
比看上去聪明
Smarter than he looks.

1647
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,540
那一定很聪明了
Pretty damn smart, then.

1648
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,300
很聪明
Pretty damn smart.

1649
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,940
你俩直接私奔得了
Ugh, why don't you two just elope, for God's sake?!

1650
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,520
无礼
Impertinent.

1651
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,370
过分
Offensive.

1652
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:12,050
其实  你介意吗
Actually, would you mind?

1653
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,300
完全不
Not at all.

1654
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,840
-本来就该我了  -是啊
- It was my turn. - Quite so.

1655
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,580
你打算怎么醒过来
So how do you plan to wake up?

1656
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,210
就这样吧
I should think like this.

1657
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:34,990
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1658
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,630
偷偷告诉你  约翰  坠落是杀不死我的
Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall.

1659
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:39,970
可你是怎么做到
But how?

1660
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,660
很简单的  亲爱的华生
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1661
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,660
-想我了吗  -夏洛克  你没事吧
- Miss me? - Sherlock, are you all right?

1662
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:19,370
是的  当然  我怎么会有事呢
Yes. Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?

1663
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,620
因为你可能刚服药过量  你该入院
Because you probably just OD'd. You should be in hospital.

1664
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,790
没时间了
Hm, no time.

1665
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:26,100
我得赶紧去贝克街  莫里亚蒂回来了
I have to go to Baker Street now, Moriarty's back.

1666
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,360
我都希望他是真回来了
I almost hope he is,

1667
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,590
如果能让你不再沉迷于此
if it'll save you from this.

1668
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,090
现在用不着这个了
No need for that now,

1669
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:35,770
我有真正好玩的了
I've got the real thing.

1670
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:37,900
-我有工作了  -夏洛克
- I have work to do. - Sherlock...

1671
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,340
答应我
..Promise me.

1672
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,720
你还站这儿干什么
What are you still doing here?

1673
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,620
你不是该去帮我搞个赦免还是什么的吗
Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something,

1674
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,140
像个好大哥那样
like a proper big brother?

1675
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,670
华生医生
Dr Watson...

1676
01:25:58,130 --> 01:25:59,220
照顾好他
Look after him.

1677
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,840
拜托
Please.

1678
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,380
夏洛克  等等  解释一下
Sherlock, hang on, explain.

1679
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,860
莫里亚蒂还活着吗
Moriarty's alive, then?

1680
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,090
我没说他活着  我说他回来了
I never said he was alive, I said he was back.

1681
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,310
那么他死了吗
So he's dead?

1682
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:30,130
他当然死了
Of course he's dead,

1683
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:32,260
他开枪爆了自己的头  不可能活下来
he blew his own brains out, no-one survives that.

1684
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:35,170
我刚刚为了证明这点而服药过量
I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.

1685
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:39,070
莫里亚蒂死了  毫无疑问
Moriarty is dead, no question.

1686
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:44,170
但更重要的是  我很清楚他接下来要做什么
But more importantly, I know exactly what he's going to do next.

1687
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:55,560
飞行机
Flying machines,

1688
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,830
还有什么...电话
these, er, telephone contraptions?

1689
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,800
这是什么疯狂的幻想啊
What sort of lunatic fantasy is that?

1690
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,870
只是我对
It was simply my conjecture

1691
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:02,360
未来世界
of what a future world might look like

1692
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:04,790
和你我在其中角色的猜想
and how you and I might fit inside it.

1693
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,190
一个逻辑学家应该可以从一滴水
From a drop of water a logician should be able to infer

1694
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:09,690
推断出是大西洋还是尼亚加拉河
the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara.

1695
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,070
或是莱辛巴赫瀑布
Or a Reichenbach?

1696
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:13,920
-你把这桩案子写好了吗  -是的
- Have you written up your account of the case? - Yes.

1697
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,360
经过修改把它写成了
Modified to put it down as

1698
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,040
-罕见的我未能破案的案例了吧  -当然
- one of my rare failures, of course? - Of course.

1699
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,610
《无形军队
The Adventure Of...

1700
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,590
历险记》
The Invisible Army.

1701
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,650
或者愤怒军团
The League Of Furies?

1702
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:31,160
恐怖军团
The Monstrous Regiment?

1703
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,910
我倒想起名为《恐怖新娘》
I rather thought The Abominable Bride.

1704
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:37,160
-有点庸俗  -但会畅销的
- A trifle lurid. - It'll sell.

1705
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,740
而且还包含了正式八经的谋杀
It's got proper murders in it too.

1706
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,910
你是这方面的专家嘛
You're the expert.

1707
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,070
至于你的故事
As for your own tale,

1708
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:46,820
你还确定你只用了7%的溶剂吗
are you sure it's still just a 7% solution that you take?

1709
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:49,020
我觉得你是不是调高用量了
I think you may have increased the dosage.

1710
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,930
或许我是有点异想天开了
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful.

1711
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,760
但或许  这种事真的会发生
But perhaps such things could come to pass.

1712
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,590
不管怎样  我相信我在那个世界会很自在的
In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world.

1713
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:01,400
-我看我不会的  -我不敢苟同
- Huh, I don't think I would be. - I beg to differ.

1714
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,610
但我一向知道自己是个先于时代之人
But then I've always known I was a man out of his time.
